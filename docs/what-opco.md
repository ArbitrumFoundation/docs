### What is the Arbitrum OpCo Foundation?

The Operation Company (OpCo) is a Cayman Islands foundation company tasked to act as the ArbitrumDAO's operational mesh layer. Its core mandate is to work on, manage, and provide oversight for DAO-approved initiatives that have the potential to benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem.

The ArbitrumDAO has earmarked 30M ARB to fund the OpCo for two years and six months. This allows the OpCo to hire full-time staff, take on operational responsibilities within the DAO, and propose initiatives as necessary.

Among other things, the DAO may choose to leverage the OpCo for the following:

- Operational support and project planning,
- Project management of DAO initiatives,
- Negotiations and entering into agreements with service providers,
- Allocation of resources across contributors and DAO-approved projects,
- Bridge the ArbitrumDAO and Arbitrun Aligned Entities (AAEs).

There is an on-going process now to establish the core team and more information will be available soon. 

### How does the Operation Company operate?

The Arbitrum OpCo Foundation has several parties that facilitate its operation including Foundation Directors, the Oversight and Transparency Committee (OAT), the OpCo Team and the ArbitrumDAO's token holders.

- **Foundation Directors** have a fiduciary duty to the organisation as a whole with the authority to approve / veto transactions, remove any member of the OpCo Team or OAT, provide ultimate approval or rejection for any action within the Foundation and authorise changes to the bylaws as required.

- **The OAT Committee** consists of 5 members who are elected on a yearly basis. They are responsible for holding the Foundation accountable to its mission, ratifying operational-specific tasks like the yearly budget, offering transparency to the OpCo's work to the ArbitrumDAO, assisting the OpCo team as necessary, and hiring (or terminating) team members. Additionally, the Arbitrum Foundation holds a permanent observer seat. Membership includes A.J. Warner, Frisson, Gavin Wang, Patrick McCorry and Pedro Breuer. 

- **OpCo Team** serves as the primary operator of the OpCo program from supporting contributors in the DAO, managing the proposal process including submitting their own proposals, carrying out operational duties related to DAO-approved proposals and working with all stakeholders in the Arbitrum ecosystem.

The [bylaws](../assets/ArbitrumOpCoFoundationBylaws.pdf) offer greater insight into the responsibilities of each party alongside how they can be elected or removed from their positions by the ArbitrumDAO's token holders.
