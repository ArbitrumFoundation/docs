# Creating New Arbitrum Chains
Rollup is the new server. 

In line with the rollup-centric roadmap of Ethereum, we anticipate the emergence of hundreds and thousands of rollups, dedicated to protecting users and their assets when interacting with an online service. 

The following section covers the basics on Arbitrum Orbit and the Arbitrum Expansion program, that enables projects to easily adopt the Arbitrum technology stack when deploying their own chain. 

## Arbitrum Orbit 

Arbitrum Orbit represents our strategy for enabling projects seeking to adopt the Arbitrum technology stack when deciding to deploy their own chain.

There are many reasons why a project will decide to launch their chain using Arbitrum Orbit:

- **Dedicated blockspace.** Gain independence from chain usage by other applications.
- **Custom gas token.** Choose which token is used for chain fees allowing you to create native economies and utility incentives.
- **Low latency.** Orbit chains have demonstrated the ability to sustain ~100ms block times. 
- **Data availability layer choices.** AnyTrust, Celestia, and more data availability solutions are already integrated into Arbiturm Orbit.
- **No governance constraints.** Control your own destiny; no need to submit to shared governance.
- **Stage 1 rollup.** External validation that the Arbitrum technology stack is amongst the best of all rollup implementations. 

In fact, Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, can be considered the first Orbit Chains, to demonstrate the capability of the technology. The proven track record of the technology has led to an explosion of projects adopting the technology stack.

## Arbitrum Expansion Program (AEP) 
The Arbitrum Foundation, in consultation with the ArbitrumDAO [[1](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-feedback-when-and-how-should-the-arbitrum-foundation-issue-a-licence-for-the-arbitrum-technology-stack-to-a-new-strategic-partner/15758),[2](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-arbitrum-expansion-program-and-developer-guild/20722),[3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/temperature-check-change-arbitrum-expansion-program-to-allow-deployments-of-new-orbit-chains-on-any-blockchain/23280)], put together the Arbitrum Expansion Program to help enable projects to deploy and operate their own chain using the Arbitrum technology stack. 

The [Arbitrum Expansion Program](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/aep/ArbitrumExpansionProgramTerms.pdf) is designed to be a self-service path for any project seeking to adopt the Arbitrum Technology stack. It allows the project to fork the code and modify it according to their business needs alongside to deploy on any blockchain network. In return, the project is required to pay 10% of their chain’s profit back to the ArbitrumDAO with 8% distributed to the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury and 2% to a Arbitrum Protocol Developer guild. 

Our program is designed with the following spirit in mind:

- **Permissionless.** Any project can deploy a chain using the Arbitrum technology stack as long as they agree to opt-in to the Arbitrum Expansion Program. There is no need to contact the Arbitrum Foundation. 
- **Deploy on any chain.** Projects are allowed to deploy an Orbit Chain on any blockchain network including Ethereum, Bitcoin, other L2s, etc. 
- **Modify & fork.** Projects can modify the Arbitrum technology stack to suit their business needs.
- **Value accrual.** Support the Arbitrum ecosystem by sending a portion of the chain’s revenue back to the ArbitrumDAO and the Arbitrum Developer guild.
- **Community enablement.** Additional community-run features, alongside the software license, that will act as a supportive cornerstone for projects that adopt the Arbitrum technology stack.
- **Freedom to innovate.** There is no limitation on how a chain governs itself such as a requirement to submit to shared governance or other similar constraining structures.

Put another way, you are free to adopt the Arbitrum technology stack, deploy your chain, expand the Ethereum ecosystem, and ultimately serve your users. In regards to the fee collection, we will update our documentation will further information shortly.
