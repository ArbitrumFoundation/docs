**In a nutshell:**

- Arbitrum Rollup is an optimistic rollup protocol that makes Ethereum transactions faster and cheaper while inheriting Ethereum's security guarantees [[1]](#footnote-1). Developers use Arbitrum to build user-friendly decentralized apps.
- Governance of the Arbitrum Rollup protocol is now being decentralized through the distribution of $ARB governance tokens.
- $ARB tokens can be used to vote on Arbitrum DAO governance proposals, allowing $ARB holders to shape Arbitrum’s future together.
- Token holders will be able to delegate voting power to trusted individuals. These individuals are called delegates.
- **To determine your airdrop eligibility**, connect your wallet to the Arbitrum One network on [gov.arbitrum.io](http://gov.arbitrum.io) and follow the prompts. Do this by (todo).
- **To become an Arbitrum DAO delegate**, review the below material and then **submit your application** (todo).
- **To build decentralized apps on Arbitrum,** check out our [developer docs](https://developer.arbitrum.io/intro/).


### Hello! What’s Arbitrum again?

Arbitrum Rollup is an optimistic rollup protocol that makes Ethereum transactions faster and cheaper. Developers use Arbitrum to build user-friendly decentralized apps.

Our flagship chain, Arbitrum One, was [launched in 2021](https://offchain.medium.com/introducing-arbitrum-one-our-mainet-beta-ed0e9b63b435). This was quickly followed by the launch of [Arbitrum Nova](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/introducing-nova-arbitrum-anytrust-mainnet-is-open-for-developers-9a54692f345e), a separate [AnyTrust chain](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/introducing-anytrust-chains-cheaper-faster-l2-chains-with-minimal-trust-assumptions-31def59eb8d7) built for developers who need ultra low-cost transactions. In August 2022, Arbitrum One was [upgraded to the Arbitrum Nitro stack](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/arbitrum-nitro-one-small-step-for-l2-one-giant-leap-for-ethereum-bc9108047450), bringing a 7-10x upgrade to Arbitrum’s scaling capabilities.

Governance of the Arbitrum Rollup protocol is now being decentralized through the distribution of $ARB governance tokens.


### What's governance?

Governance is the way that decisions get made. To understand what this means, let’s compare traditional web2 governance to web3 governance.

**Web2 technologies** are traditionally built by corporations governed by a board of directors. This board is usually a small group of people elected by shareholders. 

When a corporate decision needs to be made, members of the board meet and vote. The board’s decision-making protocols aren’t always visible to shareholders. Although the board has a fiduciary duty to its shareholders, shareholders must trust the board. This is a sort of *social contract* expressed as *corporate legalese* and enforced by *law*.

**Web3 technologies** (like Arbitrum) are often built by corporations governed *initially* by a board of directors. Once these technologies achieve product-market fit, the board can gradually decentralize its decision-making authority. This is called [progressive decentralization](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/), and it’s what Arbitrum is doing. Progressive decentralization is usually facilitated by three key ingredients:

1. **DAO formation**: DAO = [Decentralized autonomous organization](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/09/20/daos.html). The DAO gradually absorbs the board’s decision-making authority. Arbitrum’s DAO is the **Arbitrum DAO**.
2. **Governance token launch**: Ownership of governance tokens represents membership within the DAO. Token holders can vote on DAO proposals. Arbitrum’s governance token is **$ARB**, and will be distributed to eligible wallet addresses via an upcoming airdrop.
3. **Code**: DAO governance is usually facilitated by a series of open source [smart contracts](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_2.html) that enforce a specific decision-making protocol. These *trustless* smart contracts are used to gradually replace the traditional board’s *trusted* social contract. Arbitrum DAO uses smart contracts to codify the decision-making protocol articulated within the Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO.

### So $ARB is a token, kind of like $ETH?

Kind of! Let’s compare them:

**How $ETH and $ARB are similar**:

- Both are powered by decentralized blockchain technology.
- Both can be owned by any cryptocurrency wallet that supports $ETH.
- Both can be bought, sold, and traded.

**How $ETH and $ARB are different**:

- $ETH is a transactional token, while $ARB is a governance token.
- $ETH is used to pay for transaction fees, while $ARB is not.
- Governance of the Arbitrum Rollup protocol is facilitated by $ARB and governance smart contracts, while [Ethereum’s governance](https://ethereum.org/en/governance/) is handled socially.
- Holding $ARB makes you a partial owner of the Arbitrum Rollup protocol, while holding $ETH does not make you a partial owner of the Ethereum’s protocol.


### Why is this important? Why should I care?

**In short:** You can use $ARB tokens to defend our shared values of decentralization, self-sovereignty, and sustainable economics.

**Elaborating**: The Arbitrum Rollup protocol inherits Ethereum’s base-layer security guarantees along with its values. Decentralization of the Arbitrum Rollup protocol's governance represents an important step towards community ownership of Ethereum’s scaling technologies, and further aligns our incentives with those of the Ethereum community at large.

$ARB tokens represent stake in Arbitrum’s - and by proxy, Ethereum’s - decentralized future. You can use them to help us collectively determine how to scale Ethereum’s [infinite garden](https://ethereum.foundation/infinitegarden) into the future.
