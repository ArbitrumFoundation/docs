## Security council

### How does Arbitrum's governance mechanism mitigate the risk of Security Council members abusing their power through Emergency Actions?


### What qualifies as an Emergency Action?


### Doesn't the presence of a permissioned Security Council defeat the purpose of permissionless decentralization?
<p>The <a href="/dao-glossary#arbitrum-rollup">Arbitrum Rollup</a> protocol is undergoing Progressive decentralization. The <a href="/dao-glossary#arbitrum-dao">Arbitrum DAO</a>, governance <a href="/dao-glossary#smart-contract">Smart contract</a>s, and <a href="/dao-glossary#the-constitution-of-the-arbitrum-dao">The Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO</a> are all components of this progressive and incomplete process. The <a href="/dao-glossary#security-council">Security Council</a> does introduce a permissioned, centralized power structure within our governance <a href="/dao-glossary#mechanism-design">Mechanism design</a>, but for good reasons: it allows a permissioned set of elected parties to handle <a href="/dao-glossary#emergency-action">Emergency action</a>s - actions that let the employees of Offchain Labs quickly address sensitive vulnerabilities. <br />
<br />
Without the Security Council, we'd be forced to expose exploitable vulnerabilities to adversaries in the form of governance proposals. This introduces a democratically managed centralization of power. This is an example of a tactical compromise with our shared values - a pragmatic check on ideals. Similar to Ethereum's <a href="/dao-glossary#offchain-governance">Off-chain governance</a> mechanism.<br />
<br />
As we continue building confidence through iteration and experimentation, the <a href="/dao-glossary#arbitrum-dao">Arbitrum DAO</a> will democratically determine the manner in which the Security Council's role changes, and the rate at which the remaining centralized components of our governance mechanism design become decentralized.</p>



## Governance architecture

### What kinds of governance "principles" have been codified into this mechanism design?
<p>A few that come to mind:</p>

<p></p>

<ol><li>Changes to Arbitrum's governance should be sufficiently debated on the Arbitrum DAO governance forum.</li>
<li><a href="/dao-glossary#governance-proposal">Governance proposal</a>s should give DAO members enough time to solicit feedback from peers and experts. This time period is called TODO.</li>
<li>If someone disagrees with the direction that an approved proposal is taking <a href="/dao-glossary#arbitrum-dao">Arbitrum DAO</a> (and the protocols it governs), they should be able to exit the system before the proposed changes take effect. See TODO to learn more about this mechanism.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>



### Could Arbitrum's protocol governance become enshrined within Ethereum's L1 social consensus mechanism, removing the notion of "chain ownership"?
It's technically possible. For this to happen, the change would have to be initiated through a governance proposal, then discussed by members of the Arbitrum DAO, then approved through a temperature check, and then formally approved by $ARB token-holders through an on-chain vote. It's largely out of our hands.

## $ARB token and airdrop

### Have you identified any Sybils?
Yes. You can find a list of denylisted addresses we identified as Sybils here [link to github or something]

### Will there be multiple airdrops?
No, this will be the only airdrop.
