## Security council

### Doesn't the presence of a permissioned Security Council defeat the purpose of permissionless decentralization? {#doesnt-the-presence-of-a-permissioned-security-council-defeat-the-purpose-of-permissionless-decentralization}
<p>The <a href="/dao-glossary#arbitrum-rollup-protocol"><strong>Arbitrum Rollup (protocol)</strong></a> protocol is undergoing Progressive decentralization. The <a href="/dao-glossary#arbitrum-dao">Arbitrum DAO</a>, governance <a href="/dao-glossary#smart-contract">Smart contract</a>s, and <a href="/dao-glossary#the-constitution-of-the-arbitrum-dao">The Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO</a> are all components of this progressive and incomplete process. The <a href="/dao-glossary#security-council">Security Council</a> does introduce a permissioned, centralized power structure within our governance <a href="/dao-glossary#mechanism-design">Mechanism design</a>, but for good reasons: it allows a permissioned set of elected parties to handle <a href="/dao-glossary#emergency-action">Emergency action</a>s - actions that let the employees of Offchain Labs quickly address sensitive vulnerabilities. <br />
<br />
Without the Security Council, we'd be forced to expose exploitable vulnerabilities to adversaries in the form of governance proposals. This introduces a democratically managed centralization of power. This is an example of a tactical compromise with our shared values - a pragmatic check on ideals. Similar to Ethereum's <a href="/dao-glossary#offchain-governance">Off-chain governance</a> mechanism.<br />
<br />
As we continue building confidence through iteration and experimentation, the <a href="/dao-glossary#arbitrum-dao">Arbitrum DAO</a> will democratically determine the manner in which the Security Council's role changes, and the rate at which the remaining centralized components of our governance mechanism design become decentralized.</p>



### How are people elected to the Security Council? {#how-are-people-elected-to-the-security-council}
<p><a href="/dao-glossary#security-council">Security Council</a> membership is determined by a <a href="/dao-glossary#security-council-election">Security Council election</a> that happens every six months, or twice a year. See TODO for more detailed information on this election's <a href="/dao-glossary#mechanism-design">Mechanism design</a>.</p>

## Governance architecture

### What kinds of governance "principles" have been codified into this mechanism design? {#what-kinds-of-governance-principles-have-been-codified-into-this-mechanism-design}
<p>A few that come to mind:</p>

<p></p>

<ol><li>Changes to Arbitrum's governance should be sufficiently debated on the Arbitrum DAO governance forum.</li>
<li><a href="/dao-glossary#governance-proposal">Governance proposal</a>s should give DAO members enough time to solicit feedback from peers and experts. This time period is called TODO.</li>
<li>If someone disagrees with the direction that an approved proposal is taking <a href="/dao-glossary#arbitrum-dao">Arbitrum DAO</a> (and the protocols it governs), they should be able to exit the system before the proposed changes take effect. See TODO to learn more about this mechanism.</li>
</ol>

### Could Arbitrum's protocol governance become enshrined within Ethereum's L1 social consensus mechanism, removing the notion of "chain ownership"? {#could-arbitrums-protocol-governance-become-enshrined-within-ethereums-l1-social-consensus-mechanism-removing-the-notion-of-chain-ownership}
<p>It's technically possible. For this to happen, the change would have to be initiated through a governance proposal, then discussed by members of the Arbitrum DAO, then approved through a temperature check, and then formally approved by $ARB token-holders through an on-chain vote. It's largely out of our hands.</p>

### Have you identified any Sybils? {#have-you-identified-any-sybils}
<p>Yes. You can find a list of denylisted addresses we identified as Sybils here [link to github or something]</p>
