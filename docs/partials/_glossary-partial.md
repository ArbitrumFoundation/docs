<p>Internal only? Talking about the contract itself feels "implementation detail" to me</p>

<p></p>



### Immutable {#immutable}
<p>In the context of Ethereum, immutability refers to the inability to change the data recorded in the blockchain. You can think of Ethereum's blockchain as a decentralized, distributed linked-list data structure that stores the entire history of transactions within a globally distributed network of computers running Ethereum client software.<br />
<br />
The client software implements a protocol that stores transaction history within a data structure known as a "block"; blocks are linked to other blocks in chronological order. Because each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, it's extremely difficult to change transaction data after it's been recorded as canonical by the network.<br />
</p>

<p></p>

Layer 2 solutions aim to increase scalability and reduce the cost of transactions on Ethereum's Layer 1 without introducing additional trust assumptions.</p>

### Mechanism design {#mechanism-design}
<p>The process of designing protocols - or mechanisms - that incentivize specific behaviors. Within the context of Ethereum, mechanism design usually refers to mechanisms that attempt to align the incentives of participants in order to achieve particular outcomes in a fair and transparent manner.

An example of an off-chain governance action is taking a "temperature check" on a proposal before submitted it to the <a href="/dao-glossary#governor-contract">Governor contract</a>.  </p>

### On-chain governance {#onchain-governance}
<p>As opposed to off-chain governance, social governance, or pseudo governance. On-chain governance is governance implemented by <a href="/dao-glossary#smart-contract">Smart contract</a>s that allow DAO members to determine - through the use of <a href="/dao-glossary#governance-proposal">Governance proposal</a>s - how the DAO allocates its resources and updates its protocols.

### Presale {#presale}
<p>Also known as an initial coin offering (ICO). Presales are fundraising events in which a new cryptocurrency project sells a portion of its tokens to early backers. <strong><em>Arbitrum DAO did not and will never engage in a presale.</em></strong></p>

### Progressive decentralization {#progressive-decentralization}
<p>The process of gradually increasing the decentralization of a system over time.

### Trustless {#trustless}
<p>In the context of Ethereum, trustless refers to the ability of a system to operate without reliance on a central authority or intermediary. Instead, users place their trust in math and protocols.<br />
<br />
This is achieved through the use of cryptographic techniques and decentralized consensus mechanisms that let users verify the integrity of network transactions using open-source software. Trustless systems are considered to be more secure and resistant to fraud or tampering because they don't rely on a single point of failure that can be exploited by attackers.</p>

<p></p>



### Unclaimed airdrop tokens {#unclaimed-airdrop-tokens}
<p>Claimable <a href="/dao-glossary#arb">$ARB</a> tokens in the <a href="/dao-glossary#token-distributor-contract">Token Distributor Contract</a> not claimed by their potential owners.</p>

### Votable tokens {#votable-tokens}
