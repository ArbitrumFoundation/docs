### Immutable {#immutable}
<p>In the context of Ethereum, immutability refers to the inability to change the data recorded in the blockchain. You can think of Ethereum's blockchain as a decentralized, distributed linked-list data structure that stores the entire history of transactions within a globally distributed network of computers running Ethereum client software.<br />
<br />
The client software implements a protocol that stores transaction history within a data structure known as a "block"; blocks are linked to other blocks in chronological order. Because each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, it's extremely difficult to change transaction data after it's been recorded as canonical by the network.<br />
</p>

<p></p>

An example of an off-chain governance action is taking a "temperature check" on a proposal before submitting it to the governor contract.</p>

### On-chain governance {#onchain-governance}
<p>As opposed to off-chain governance, social governance, or pseudo governance. On-chain governance is governance implemented by <a href="/dao-glossary#smart-contract">Smart contract</a>s that allow DAO members to determine - through the use of <a href="/dao-glossary#governance-proposal">Governance proposal</a>s - how the DAO allocates its resources and updates its protocols.

### Proposal waiting period {#proposal-waiting-period}
<p>A contract-enforced delay period of roughly two weeks that begins after a <a href="/dao-glossary#governance-proposal">Governance proposal</a> is accepted, and after which the proposal takes effect. The proposal waiting period is intended to give users the option of opting out (for example, by withdrawing their funds).</p>
