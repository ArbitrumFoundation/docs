### $ARB
Arbitrum's governance token, an ERC-20 token native to the Arbitrum One chain. Owning $ARB makes you a member of the Arbitrum DAO and allows you to participate in Arbitrum's on-chain governance.

### $ARB reverse gateway
A series of smart contracts responsible for bridging $ARB between Ethereum and Arbitrum One. The $ARB token is native to Arbitrum One, meaning it's minted within a smart contract that lives on the Arbitrum One chain.<br />
<br />
The "reverse" gateway keeps the full $ARB supply escrowed in Arbitrum One, and mints or burns the L1 token representation upon deposits/withdrawals.<br />
<br />
The reverse gateway is often compared to the "standard gateway", which mints/burns on L2.

### Airdrop
A mechanism that distributes tokens to qualifying wallet addresses, usually based on on-chain activity.<br/>The Arbitrum Foundation airdrop will distribute $ARB tokens to eligible wallet addresses on TODO according to the airdrop eligibility and distribution criteria specified in <a href='/airdrop-eligibility-distribution'>$ARB airdrop eligibility and distribution specifications</a>.

### AnyTrust chain
An Arbitrum chain that implements the Arbitrum AnyTrust protocol, a protocol that significantly reduces transaction costs by using a trusted Data Availability Committee to expedite Ethereum's trustless data availability mechanism. Arbitrum Nova is an example of an AnyTrust chain. Arbitrum One is not an AnyTrust chain; it's an Arbitrum Rollup chain.

### Arbitrum AnyTrust
An Arbitrum protocol that manages data availability with a permissioned set of parties known as the Data Availability Committee. This protocol reduces transaction fees by introducing an additional trust assumption that expedites Ethereum's trustless data availability mechanism. Arbitrum Nova is an example of an AnyTrust chain.<br/><br/>Arbitrum One is an alternative chain that implements the purely trustless Arbitrum Rollup protocol without introducing additional security assumptions.

### Arbitrum chain
A Layer 2 EVM-compatible environment running on Ethereum using Arbitrum technologies. Arbitrum chains come in two forms: Rollup and AnyTrust. Rollup is fully trustless and doesn't introduce additional security assumptions; AnyTrust is cheaper because of the trust assumptions that it introduces.

### Arbitrum DAO
The worldwide community of $ARB token holders and delegates. Governs the Arbitrum One chain, the Arbitrum Nova chain, the Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO, and the Security Council.

### Arbitrum Foundation
A legal entity that represents the Arbitrum DAO. Is bound to the rules articulated within the Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO.

### Arbitrum Foundation tokens
$ARB tokens owned by the Arbitrum DAO Treasury.

### Arbitrum Improvement Proposal (AIP)
A governance proposal as defined by The Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO.

### Arbitrum Nova
The first Arbitrum AnyTrust chain running on Ethereum mainnet. Currently in Beta. (TODO - align on retaining Beta after Governance launch)
