  <dt>Airdrop</dt>
  <dd data-quicklook-key="airdrop">A mechanism that rewards early adopters with tokens. The number of tokens rewarded to a particular user's wallet address is usually determined by an analysis of their wallet's on-chain activity. <br/><br/> The Arbitrum Foundation airdrop will distribute $ARB tokens to eligible wallet addresses on TODO according to the airdrop eligibility and distribution criteria outlined here (TODO).</dd>
  <dt>AnyTrust chain</dt>
  <dd data-quicklook-key="anytrust-chain">An Arbitrum chain that implements the Arbitrum AnyTrust protocol, a protocol that trades trustless data availability for low transaction costs.

  <dt>Immutable</dt>
  <dd data-quicklook-key="immutable">In the context of Ethereum, immutability refers to the inability to change the data recorded in the blockchain. You can think of Ethereum's blockchain as a decentralized, distributed linked-list data structure that stores the entire history of transactions within a globally distributed network of computers running Ethereum client software. <br/><br/> The client software implements a protocol that stores transaction history within a data structure known as a "block"; blocks are linked to other blocks in chronological order. Because each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, it's extremely difficult to change transaction data after it's been recorded as canonical by the network. This is why we consider the Ethereum blockchain to be immutable. Chains that implement Arbitrum's Rollup protocol (like Arbitrum One) are also immutable, as they inherit the security properties of Ethereum-as-a-base-layer.</dd>

  <dd data-quicklook-key="nonconstitutional-proposal">Any governance proposal that doesn't meet the criteria to be considered “constitutional”; requires a lower threshold to pass. </dd>
  <dt>Off-chain governance action</dt>
  <dd data-quicklook-key="offchain-governance-action">One of two types of governance actions allowed by the Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO. Off-chain actions are actions that are executed without smart contracts. Updating the text of the Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO is an example of an off-chain action. Note that in this example, the governance action is facilitated by on-chain Constitutional proposal, while the execution of the action happens off-chain.</dd>
  <dt>On-chain governance</dt>
  <dd data-quicklook-key="onchain-governance">As opposed to off-chain governance, social governance, or pseudo governance. On-chain governance is governance implemented by immutable smart contracts that allow DAO members to determine - through the use of governance proposals - how the DAO allocates its resources and updates its protocols. The Arbitrum DAO utilizes on-chain governance.</dd>
  <dt>On-chain governance action</dt>
  <dd data-quicklook-key="onchain-governance-action">One of two types of governance actions allowed by the Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO.

  <dt>Smart contract</dt>
  <dd data-quicklook-key="smart-contract">Self-executing code that's stored and executed on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts let you to trustlessly automate tasks. The Arbitrum DAO uses smart contracts to trustlessly implement the protocol defined by The Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO.</dd>
  <dt>The Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO</dt>
  <dd data-quicklook-key="the-constitution-of-the-arbitrum-dao">A formal document that lays out the rules, procedures, and community values by which the Arbitrum DAO operates.

Instead, users place their trust in math and protocols.<br/><br/>This is achieved through the use of cryptographic techniques and decentralized consensus mechanisms that allow users to verify the integrity of network transactions using open-source software. Trustless systems are considered to be more secure and resistant to fraud or tampering because they don't rely on a single point of failure that could be exploited by attackers.</dd>
  <dt>Unclaimed airdrop tokens</dt>

    <li>tokens owned by the Arbitrum DAO</li>
   <li>tokens owned by the Arbitrum Foundation</li>
   <li>airdrop tokens not yet claimed</li>
