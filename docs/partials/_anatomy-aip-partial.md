The Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO defines the following sections of an AIP:

- **Abstract** - A short (~200 word) description of the AIP.
- **Motivation** - The motivation is critical for AIPs that want to change the Arbitrum ecosystem. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol or implementation is inadequate to address the problem that the AIP solves. AIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.
- **Rationale** - The rationale describes the motivation and value proposition in terms of how the AIP aligns with the Arbitrum community's mission and guiding values.
-  **Key Terms** - The key terms section defines the terms used in the AIP. This section is optional, but recommended.
- **Specifications** - The technical specification should describe a detailed breakdown of the platforms and technologies that will be used. This is where you can elaborate on the "why" of your design decisions. You can also use this section to describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how similar specifications been successfully (or unsuccessfully) implemented in other chains or languages.
-  **Steps to Implement** - The steps to implement the AIP, including associated costs and other resources for each step where applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, any AIPs involving transactions with third parties (such as grants) will need to ensure that applicable legal documentation and procedures are also included.
-  **Timeline** - The timeline section should include a list of key steps along with the anticipated completion date for each of them.
-  **Overall Cost** - The overall cost section should include a breakdown of the total cost of the AIP, including any associated costs for each step where applicable. Consider both fixed costs and recurring costs.

Sometimes, AIPs aren't passed on the first try. If an AIP is not passed, the proposer may resubmit the AIP after addressing the concerns of the community. The proposer should include the following additional sections in the resubmitted AIP:

- **A link to the previous AIP** - The link to the previous AIP should be included in the resubmitted AIP.
-  **Reasons why the AIP was not passed** - The reasons why the AIP was not passed should be included in the resubmitted AIP.
-  **Changes made to the AIP** - The changes made to the AIP should be included to address the concerns raised during the previous AIP submission.
-  **Additional information** - More detailed intentions, specifics and implication details can help the community understand the revised AIP, increasing the chances of it being passed.
