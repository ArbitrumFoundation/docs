The Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO defines the following sections of an AIP:

- **Abstract** - A short (~200 word) description of the AIP.
- **Motivation** - The motivation is critical for AIPs that want to change the Arbitrum ecosystem. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol or implementation is inadequate to address the problem that the AIP solves. AIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.
- **Rationale** - The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.
-  **Key Terms** - The key terms section defines the terms used in the AIP. This section is optional, but recommended.
- **Specifications** - The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Arbitrum platforms.
-  **Steps to Implement** - The steps to implement the AIP, including associated costs, manpower, and other resources for each step where applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, any AIPs involving transactions with third parties (such as grants) will need to ensure that applicable legal documentation and procedures are also included.
-  **Timeline** - The timeline section should include a list of key steps along with the anticipated completion date for each of them.
-  **Overall Cost** - The overall cost section should include a breakdown of the total cost of the AIP, including any associated costs for each step where applicable. Consider both fixed costs and recurring costs.

Sometimes, AIPs aren't passed on the first try. If an AIP is not passed, the proposer may resubmit the AIP after addressing the concerns of the community. The proposer should include the following additional sections in the resubmitted AIP:

- **A link to the previous AIP** - The link to the previous AIP should be included in the resubmitted AIP.
-  **Reasons why the AIP was not passed** - The reasons why the AIP was not passed should be included in the resubmitted AIP.
-  **Changes made to the AIP** - The changes made to the AIP should be included to address the concerns raised during the previous AIP submission.
-  **Additional information** - More detailed intentions, specifics and implication details can help the community understand the revised AIP, increasing the chances of it being passed.
