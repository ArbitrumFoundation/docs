 1. Editing for technical precision and completeness (we are here - once an SME signs off on this "core truth", we can edit for structure / clarity / brevity / consistency - see the gov docs page for details: https://www.notion.so/arbitrum/Governance-docs-46934705e74b4ae096b2fcdb3755aa40)
   - This unblocks other types of editing 
   - Other editorial feedback is welcome of course, but the most important feedback at this point is editing for technical precision and completeness. SME-signoff signals that from the SME's perspective, it looks truthful and complete.
 2. Other things that we need to do (can parallelize, but confidence will increase as we have SME signoffs on technical accuracy and completeness)
   - Editing for structure / clarity / brevity / consistency / metadata
      - Examples of things in this step: logical and patterned sections, consistent formatting, consistency across the corpus, consistent usage of proper nouns, thoughtful SEO-friendly descriptions
   - link to docs (wherever the reader is likely to want to read supporting docs, link to them inline, and wire up "next" and "prev" links at the bottom of each page)
   - wire up quicklooks (wrap first-mentions of key terms in <a data-quicklook-from> tags, and ensure the definitions are in the glossary, signed off by SMEs, and rendered using Glossary CMS)
   - ask questions and add to FAQ (wherever a given reader persona - user, dev, token-holder, delegate, proposal submitter, council member, etc) is likely to have questions, add a question to the FAQ and render it within a FAQs section by using the FAQ CMS publishing pipeline)
   - continue refining term definitions (periodically review the Glossary CMS to drive consistency and clarity through iteration, ideally with continuous peer review and support)
   - reference specific sections of the constitution from each statement, whenever possible (via markdown-not-html-footnotes that connect the statement to the constitution while disarming various forms of skepticism, confusion, and risk)
   - invite peers to help with the long-tail of todos, & peer-review content experience and comment on friction points (right now we determine gov, once the switch is flipped, it will determine us, feels important to get this right for "the spirit of our work" and risk / optics reasons)
   - confidently shift our focus to fun non-gov things together!

As a delegate of the Arbitrum DAO, you play a vital role in the governance and decision-making process used to govern both the DAO's protocol and its technology assets. Your role is to represent the interests of token holders who have delegated their voting power to you, and to make informed decisions on their behalf. Whether you're a first-time delegate or a seasoned pro, building a strong delegate platform that's aligned with the interests and values of Ethereum at large is of critical importance.

In this how-to, we present a number of tips that will help you build a strong delegate platform as a delegate of the Arbitrum DAO.


### Tip 1: Understand the Constitution

The first step in building a strong delegate platform is to have a thorough understanding of The Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO. The Constitution outlines the governance structure of the DAO, including the roles and responsibilities of delegates, as well as the decision-making process. Be sure to read the Constitution in its entirety and familiarize yourself with its contents. Review our [comprehension check](../comprehension-check.md) to test your knowledge of the Constitution.

### Tip 2: Communicate with token holders

As a delegate, it's important to maintain an open and transparent line of communication with the token holders you represent. This can include creating a website or social media presence where you can provide updates on your activities, answer questions, and solicit feedback. Ensure that your voters are informed of any important developments or changes related to the DAO by staying tuned in to the latest news and updates (TODO). By communicating with your voters, you can build trust and credibility with them, and position yourself as a valuable representative of the Arbitrum DAO community.

### Tip 3: Stay active in the community

Another key aspect of building a strong delegate platform is staying active in the community. This can include participating in discussions on the DAO's governance forum, attending community events, and contributing to the development of the DAO. By staying active in the community, you can build trust and credibility with token holders and position yourself as a valuable member of the DAO.

### Tip 4: Be transparent and accountable

Transparency and accountability are crucial for building a strong delegate platform. As a delegate, you have a responsibility to be transparent about your motivations and decisions, and to be accountable to the token holders you represent. This can include being open to feedback and criticism and being willing to answer questions and address concerns.

### Tip 5: Build a strong support system

Building a strong support system is essential for success as a delegate. This can include building relationships with key members of the community and developing a team to assist you with research, analysis, and decision-making. A strong support system can help you stay informed, make better decisions, and build a more effective delegate platform.

We hope that these tips will help you build a strong delegate platform as a delegate of the Arbitrum DAO. As a delegate, you play a vital role in the governance and decision-making process of the DAO; a strong platform can help you be more effective in that role. Remember to stay informed, be transparent and accountable, and build a strong support system. And always try to be in touch with your voters and to listen to their opinion and feedback. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to us on the DAO's governance forum, we'll be happy to help.
