As a delegate of the Arbitrum DAO, you play a vital role in the governance and decision-making process used to govern both the DAO's protocol and its technologies. Your role is to represent the interests of token holders who have delegated their voting power to you, and to make informed decisions on their behalf. Whether you're a first-time delegate or a seasoned pro, building a strong delegate platform that's aligned with the interests and values of Ethereum at large is of critical importance. The following tips will help you build a strong, incentives-aligned delegate platform:


### Tip 1: Understand the Constitution

The first step in building a strong delegate platform is to develop a thorough understanding of [The Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO](../dao-constitution). The Constitution outlines the governance structure of the DAO, including the roles and responsibilities of delegates, as well as the decision-making process. Review the [comprehension check](../dao-comprehension-check.md) to test your knowledge of the Constitution.

### Tip 2: Communicate with token holders

As a delegate, it's important to maintain an open and transparent line of communication with the token holders you represent. This can include creating a website or social media presence where you can provide updates on your activities, answer questions, and solicit feedback. Ensure that your voters are informed of any important developments or changes related to the DAO by staying tuned in to the [Arbitrum DAO governance forum](https://forum.arbitrum.io/) and [Discord](https://www.discord.gg/arbitrum). Continuously relaying important information to the token holders that you represent can help you build trust and credibility while positioning yourself as a valuable representative of the Arbitrum DAO community.

### Tip 3: Stay active in the community

Another key aspect of building a strong delegate platform is staying active in the community. This can include participating in discussions on the [Arbitrum DAO governance forum](https://forum.arbitrum.io/), attending community events, participating in online discussions wherever relevant conversations are happening on social media, and contributing to the development of the DAO.

### Tip 4: Be transparent and accountable

Transparency and accountability are crucial for building a strong delegate platform. As a delegate, you have a responsibility to be transparent about your motivations and decisions, and to be accountable to the token holders you represent. This can include being open to feedback and criticism and being willing to answer questions and address concerns.

### Tip 5: Build a strong support system

Building a strong support system is essential for success as a delegate. This can include building relationships with key members of the community and developing a team to assist you with research, analysis, and decision-making. A strong support system can help you stay informed, make better decisions, and build a more effective delegate platform.

### Conclusion

As a delegate, you play a vital role in the governance and decision-making process of the DAO; a strong platform can help you be more effective in that role. Remember to stay informed, be transparent and accountable, and build a strong support system. And always try to stay in touch with your voters so you can meet their needs.
