In this how-to, you'll learn how to apply to become a delegate for the Arbitrum DAO. As a delegate, you'll have the ability to vote on proposals, including those that propose changes to the Constitution and other critical protocol parameters.

Before applying to become a delegate, it's important to understand the responsibilities and requirements of the role. Delegates are expected to actively participate in the decision-making process and to act in the best interests of the network. They should also be familiar with The Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO and other relevant governance documents.

To apply to become a delegate for the Arbitrum DAO, complete the following steps:

 1. Review the Constitution (todo) and other relevant governance documents to ensure that you understand the role of a delegate and the responsibilities and requirements associated with it.
 2. Review the [comprehension check](../comprehension-check.md) to self-assess your understanding of the protocol.
 3. Build a strong delegate platform (todo). This includes creating a website or social media account that outlines your qualifications, experience, and vision for the Arbitrum DAO. It's also important to demonstrate your understanding of the protocol and the issues facing the network.
 4. Submit an application to the Arbitrum DAO's governance forum using the template available here (todo).
 5. Once your application is received, it will be reviewed by TODO. If TODO, you'll become a delegate.

Becoming a delegate is a significant commitment and should not be taken lightly. TODO: elaborate on estimated time commitment, etc.
