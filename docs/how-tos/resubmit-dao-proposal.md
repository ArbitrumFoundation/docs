In this how-to, you'll learn how to resubmit a proposal to the Arbitrum DAO that was previously rejected or did not reach quorum.

### Prerequisites

To submit either a <a data-quicklook-from='temperature-check'>temperature check</a> using <a data-quicklook-from='snapshot'>Snapshot</a> or an <a data-quicklook-from='on-chain-proposal'>on-chain-proposal</a> using <a data-quicklook-from='tally'>Tally</a>, you must have an Ethereum wallet address that represents at least 0.01% of votable tokens[^1]. If you don't have enough voting power, consider delegating your votes to a delegate who can create a proposal on your behalf[^2].


### Step 1: Review the feedback from the previous proposal

The first step in resubmitting a proposal is to understand why it why it wasn't approved. Review the feedback from the previous proposal and try to identify any common concerns or objections that were raised by the community.

### Step 2: Make revisions to the proposal

Once you've identified the areas of concern, make revisions to the proposal to address them. Be sure to incorporate feedback from the community and any new information that may have become available since the original proposal was submitted.

### Step 3: Resubmit the proposal

Before resubmitting your proposal, it's important to review the feedback that you received during the previous vote. Address these concerns by editing your proposal and engaging with the community on the governance forum. After making the necessary changes, you can then conduct a new temperature check with Snapshot and resubmit your proposal on Tally. Visit [How to submit a governance proposal](./create-submit-dao-proposal) and pay close attention to the guidance within the proposal structure section; you'll want to include additional information that explicitly addresses the concerns that were raised during the previous vote.

It's worth noting that if your proposal is rejected multiple times, it may be best to reconsider the proposal altogether or to engage more extensively with the community to gather feedback and build support.

Overall, resubmitting a proposal is an iterative process that requires patience, persistence and an open mind. By working closely with the community, and by continuously improving your proposal based on feedback, you can increase your chances of getting your proposal passed.
