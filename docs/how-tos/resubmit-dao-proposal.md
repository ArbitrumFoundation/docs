In this how-to, you'll learn how to resubmit a proposal to the Arbitrum DAO that was previously rejected or did not reach quorum.

### Step 1: Review the feedback from the previous proposal

Review the feedback from the previous proposal and try to identify any common concerns or objections that were raised by the community. Align with the community on the best way to address these concerns and incorporate them into your proposal.

### Step 2: Draft a revision

Incorporate the community's feedback into a revised proposal. Consider using your original proposal's forum thread to draft this revision. Ensure that you incorporate any new information that may have become available since the original proposal was submitted.

### Step 3: Resubmit the proposal

Treat your revised proposal as a brand new proposal. Begin by conducting a new temperature check on the governance forum by following the [Submit a proposal](./create-submit-dao-proposal.md) procedure. Pay close attention to the guidance within the proposal structure section of this procedure; you'll want to include additional information that explicitly addresses the concerns that were raised during the previous submission.

If your proposal is rejected multiple times, it may be best to reconsider the proposal altogether or to engage more extensively with the community to gather feedback and build support.

Resubmitting a proposal is an iterative process that requires patience, persistence, and an open mind. By working closely with the community to capture and integrate feedback, you can increase your chances of getting your proposal passed. If you have any questions or concerns, visit the [Arbitrum DAO governance forum](https://forum.arbitrum.io/) or [Discord](https://www.discord.gg/arbitrum).
