In this how-to, you'll learn how to resubmit a proposal to the Arbitrum DAO that was previously rejected or did not reach quorum. Familiarity with Arbitrum, DAOs, Ethereum, and smart contracts is expected.

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following:

- An Ethereum wallet that holds at least 0.01% of votable $ARB tokens. This lets you submit and vote on proposals using Snapshot.
- If you're interested in submitting on-chain proposals using Tally, you'll need at least 5,000,000 votes delegated to your wallet address.


### Step 1: Review the feedback from the previous proposal

The first step in resubmitting a proposal is to understand why it was rejected or did not reach quorum. Review the feedback from the previous proposal and try to identify any common concerns or objections that were raised by the community.

### Step 2: Make revisions to the proposal

Once you've identified the areas of concern, make revisions to the proposal to address them. Be sure to incorporate feedback from the community and any new information that may have become available since the original proposal was submitted.

### Step 3: Conduct a temperature check with a Snapshot poll

Before resubmitting the proposal to the DAO, you should conduct another temperature check with a Snapshot poll to gauge the community's interest in your proposal. To create a poll on Snapshot:

1. Navigate to [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/).
2. Connect your wallet.
3. Open the Arbitrum DAO Snapshot space.
4. Create a poll that points to your forum post. Your poll should run for one week and should be decided by a simple majority.

Your proposal will pass the temperature check if it receives support from more than 50% of votable tokens. If your proposal doesn't pass the temperature check, don't submit it for an on-chain vote. Instead, head back to your forum post and engage with the community to address any concerns that they have.

### Step 4: Submit your on-chain proposal using Tally

If your proposal passed the temperature check and you have at least 5,000,000 votes delegated to your wallet address, you can recreate your on-chain proposal using Tally. To resubmit your proposal on Tally:

1. Log in to [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/) using the wallet that holds your $ARB tokens.
2. Navigate to the "explore DAOs" section or click on "My DAOs" within your Tally profile and select one of the following pages:
    - **Arbitrum Constitution**: For Constitutional Proposals
    - **Arbitrum Treasury**: For Non-Constitutional Proposals
3. Select "Create new proposal" (todo - confirm that we're creating, not updating)
4. Give the proposal a name and description (preview image is optional). Ensure that youâ€™re submitting the correct type of proposal to the right DAO page in Tally.
5. Add proposal actions to be executed if passed. For example, "transfer n ETH to 0x address".
6. Preview your proposal and either save as a draft or submit on-chain.

A proposal passes if more votes are cast in favor than against, and if the total number of votes cast in favor is at least the following fraction of the votable tokens:

 1. 5%, for a Constitutional proposal
 2. 10%, for a Non-Constitutional proposal

If your proposal is not passed, you can resubmit it after a certain period of time, depending on the type of proposal it is. Constitutional proposals can only be resubmitted after 3 months, while Non-Constitutional proposals can be resubmitted after 1 month.

Before resubmitting your proposal, it's important to review the feedback that you received during the previous vote. Address these concerns by editing your proposal and engaging with the community on the governance forum. After making the necessary changes, you can then conduct a new temperature check with Snapshot and resubmit your proposal on Tally.

It's worth noting that if your proposal is rejected multiple times, it may be best to reconsider the proposal altogether or to engage more extensively with the community to gather feedback and build support.

Overall, resubmitting a proposal is an iterative process that requires patience, persistence and an open mind. By working closely with the community, and by continuously improving your proposal based on feedback, you can increase your chances of getting your proposal passed.
