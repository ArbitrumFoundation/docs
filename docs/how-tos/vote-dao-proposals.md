# How to vote on Arbitrum DAO proposals

As a member of the Arbitrum DAO, it's important to be an active participant in the DAO's decision-making process by voting on governance proposals that other DAO members submit. The voting process can vary depending on the given proposal's stage; in this how-to, you'll learn how to locate, evaluate, and vote on proposals at each of the possible stages.

## Proposal stages

1. **Forum discussion:** Proposals are first submitted to the DAO governance forum (todo) for community discussion and debate. As a member, you can participate in the discussion and provide feedback to the proposal creator. (todo, not a member?)

2. **Temperature check:** After a week of discussion, the proposal creator may conduct a temperature check via a Snapshot poll. This is a way to more formally gauge the community's interest in the proposal.

3. **On-chain vote:** If the proposal passes the temperature check, it will move on to an on-chain vote facilitated by Tally. The proposal must receive more votes in favor than against; constitutional proposals must receive votes from at least 5% of Votable Tokens; non-constitutional proposals must receive votes from at least 3% of Votable Tokens.

## How to vote on a proposal

### Forum discussion

1. Go to the [DAO governance forum](https://forum.arbitrum.io/).
2. Locate the proposal you'd like to vote on and read through the proposal and the discussion thread.
3. Provide feedback and participate in the discussion to help shape the proposal.

### Temperature check

1. Navigate to [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/).
2. Connect your wallet.
3. Open the Arbitrum DAO Snapshot space.
4. Locate the proposal you'd like to vote on and cast your vote.

### On-chain vote

1. Log in to [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/) using the wallet that holds your $ARB tokens.
2. Navigate to the "explore DAOs" section or click on "My DAOs" within your Tally profile and select the page for either constitutional or non-constitutional proposals.
3. Locate the proposal you'd like to vote on and cast your vote.


It's important to note that you can delegate your voting power to a delegate if you don't have enough votable tokens (todo) or if you don't have the time to actively participate in the governance process. Be sure to select a delegate who demonstrates the values outlined in the Constitution (todo) and previous materials.

It's also important to evaluate proposals based on their alignment with the values and goals of the Arbitrum DAO as outlined in the Constitution. Remember that the ultimate goal of the DAO is to create a decentralized and transparent platform that benefits all members, including those who aren't yet members.

As always, this system is in its early days and will likely evolve in response to community feedback. Changes made to this process will be facilitated through proposals that follow the procedure outlined in the Constitution. For any other questions related to proposals or the voting process, refer to the Constitution or reach out to the community for assistance, we're happy to help!
