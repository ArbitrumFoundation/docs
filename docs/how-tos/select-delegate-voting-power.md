 - fact check (we are here - once an SME signs off on the core truth, we can confidently stabilize the beauty of the truth - see the gov docs page for details: https://www.notion.so/arbitrum/Governance-docs-46934705e74b4ae096b2fcdb3755aa40)
   - note that this isn't editing per se - this unblocks editing - this is distributable fact-checking. Editing for consistency / brevity / clarity / etc will be an iterative process that Mick is ultimately responsible for driving before we click publish. 
   - editorial feedback is welcome of course, but the most important feedback at this point is pure fact-checking and sign-off by SMEs on the facts. 
- then continue with...
   - editorial / structural cleanup (logical and patterned sections, consistent formatting, consistency across the corpus, thoughtful SEO-friendly descriptions, footnotes wherever just-in-case elaboration would be valuable)
   - link to docs (wherever the reader is likely to want to read supporting docs, link to them inline, and wire up "next" and "prev" links at the bottom of each page)
   - wire up quicklooks (wrap first-mentions of key terms in <a data-quicklook-from> tags, and ensure the definitions are in the glossary, signed off by SMEs, and rendered using Glossary CMS)
   - ask questions and add to FAQ (wherever a given reader persona - user, dev, token-holder, delegate, proposal submitter, council member, etc) is likely to have questions, add a question to the FAQ and render it within a FAQs section by using the FAQ CMS publishing pipeline)
   - continue refining term definitions (periodically review the Glossary CMS to drive consistency and clarity through iteration, ideally with continuous peer review and support)
   - reference specific sections of the constitution from each statement, whenever possible (via markdown-not-html-footnotes that connect the statement to the constitution while disarming various forms of skepticism, confusion, and risk)
   - invite peers to help with the long-tail of todos, & peer-review content experience and comment on friction points (right now we determine gov, once the switch is flipped, it will determine us, feels important to get this right for "the spirit of our work" and risk / optics reasons)
   - confidently shift our focus to fun non-gov things together!

Delegating your voting power is an essential part of participating in the Arbitrum DAO. As a token holder, you have the ability to vote on governance proposals and to elect members of the Security Council. However, if you don't have the time or resources to actively participate in the DAO's governance, you can still make your voice heard by delegating your voting power to a delegate. In this how-to, you'll learn how to evaluate and select a delegate.

Before you delegate your voting power, it's important to understand that by delegating your voting power, you're entrusting someone else to vote on your behalf. So it's really important to choose a delegate who aligns with your values and who you trust to make decisions in the best interest of the Arbitrum DAO and its community.

To delegate your voting power, you'll need an Ethereum wallet that holds $ARB tokens, such as MetaMask. Once you have your wallet set up, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to the Arbitrum DAO page on Tally (TODO), the decentralized governance platform that the Arbitrum DAO uses.
2. Connect your wallet to Tally by clicking on "Connect Wallet" and selecting the wallet you're using to hold your $ARB tokens.
3. Click on the "Delegate" tab on the top menu.
4. Search for the delegate you want to vote for by typing their Ethereum address or their name in the search bar.
5. Click on the "Delegate" button next to the delegate you've chosen.
6. Confirm the delegation by clicking on the "Delegate" button on the pop-up window that appears.
7. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the Ethereum network. This may take a few minutes depending on network congestion.

Once your transaction is confirmed, your voting power will be transferred to the delegate you've chosen. You can also check your delegation by going to the "Votes" tab on Tally and looking for the delegate you've chosen.

When selecting a delegate, it's important to consider the following:

 - The delegate's values, as outlined in the Constitution and their position on the proposals.
 - The delegate's track record, if they have one.
 - The delegate's level of engagement with the community and their willingness to listen and respond to feedback.
 - The delegate's level of technical expertise and their experience in the space.

By following these steps and considering these factors, you can ensure that you're delegating your voting power to a trustworthy and competent delegate who will work to further the goals of the Arbitrum DAO and its community.
