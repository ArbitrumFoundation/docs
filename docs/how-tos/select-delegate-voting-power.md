Delegating your voting power is an essential part of participating in the <a data-quicklook-from='arbitrum-dao'>Arbitrum DAO</a>. As a token holder, you have the ability to vote on governance <a data-quicklook-from='arbitrum-improvement-proposal-aip'>proposals</a> and to elect members of the <a data-quicklook-from='security-council'>Security Council</a>. However, if you don't have the time or resources to actively participate in the DAO's governance, you can still make your voice heard by delegating your voting power to a <a data-quicklook-from='delegate'>delegate</a>. In this how-to, you'll learn how to evaluate and select a delegate.

Before you delegate your voting power, it's important to understand that by delegating your voting power, you're entrusting someone else to vote on your behalf. So it's really important to choose a delegate who aligns with your values and who you trust to make decisions in the best interest of the Arbitrum DAO and its community.

To delegate your voting power, you'll need an Ethereum wallet that holds <a data-quicklook-from='arb'>$ARB</a> tokens, such as MetaMask. Once you have your wallet set up, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to the Arbitrum DAO page on Tally (TODO), the decentralized governance tooling that the Arbitrum DAO uses.
2. Connect your wallet to Tally by clicking on "Connect Wallet" and selecting the address that holds your $ARB tokens.
3. Click on the "Delegate" tab on the top menu.
4. Search for the delegate you want to vote for by typing their Ethereum address or their name in the search bar.
5. Click on the "Delegate" button next to the delegate you've chosen.
6. Confirm the delegation by clicking on the "Delegate" button on the pop-up window that appears.
7. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the Ethereum network. This may take a few minutes depending on network congestion.

Once your transaction is confirmed, your voting power will be transferred to the delegate you've chosen. You can also check your delegation by going to the "Votes" tab on Tally and looking for the delegate you've chosen.

When selecting a delegate, it's important to consider the following:

 - The delegate's values, as outlined in the [Constitution](../dao-constitution.md) and their position on the proposals.
 - The delegate's track record, if they have one.
 - The delegate's level of engagement with the community and their willingness to listen and respond to feedback.
 - The delegate's level of technical expertise and their experience in the space.

By following these steps and considering these factors, you can ensure that you're delegating your voting power to a trustworthy and competent delegate who will work to further the goals of the Arbitrum DAO and its community.
