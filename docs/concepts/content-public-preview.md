import DraftExpectationsPartial from '@site/docs/partials/_draft-expectations-partial.md'; 

The Arbitrum DAO treats docs like product. **Every governance document (excluding the [Constitution](../architecture/dao-constitution)) is a product of its own.** Individual documents begin in "public preview" and transition to "stable" as we iterate and validate. 

Public preview docs begin with a disclaimer that looks like this:

<DraftExpectationsPartial />

We use this disclaimer to **set expectations** and to **invite feedback** from readers like you. As soon as we can convince ourselves that a given document is meeting reader needs, we lift the disclaimer.

We generally convince ourselves through minimum-viable empirical validation. In general, if a document is 1) heavily utilized, 2) doesn't generate bounces, 3) doesn't have any outstanding GitHub issues, we consider it to be validated, and we lift the disclaimer. This is an informal process that we're currently iterating on; we'll update this document if our approach changes.

Note that this disclaimer does **not** apply to [The Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO](../architecture/arbitrum-dao-constitution.md). The Constitution is the ultimate arbiter of the Arbitrum protocol; its content has been enshrined within our on-chain governance mechanisms in the form of immutable smart contracts. Both the smart contracts and the governance documentation are downstream from the Constitution. The Constitution represents the most authoritative source of the Arbitrum DAO's governance truth.

### What's the difference between a draft and a public preview?

Readers generally interpret drafts as "not ready for public consumption". In the context of the Arbitrum DAO's public preview documentation, our published content is ready for public consumption with the caveat that we're still learning how to optimize it for our readers.


### Does this mean that the Arbitrum DAO isn't committed to its governance documentation?

No. We're committed to our documentation, and we're committed to iterating on it. We're just not committed to it in the same way that we're committed to the Constitution. Our governance documents are living, breathing attempts to make the Constitution and its mechanism designs more accessible. This is a continuous and iterative process. 

Our governance docs are subject to frequent change as we learn how to best serve our readers. These changes are carried out through traditional pull requests issued against our governance docs repository. While updates to the Constitution must be proposed and approved through Arbitrum DAO's formal governance proposal mechanism, updates to governance documentation aren't subject to this formal process.


### Is the governance protocol itself in public preview?

No. This disclaimer applies only to the docs that it appears within. It doesn't apply to the protocol; it doesn't apply to the Constitution; it doesn't apply to the smart contracts; it doesn't apply to the DAO. The Arbitrum DAO's governance protocol is in production. The Arbitrum DAO's governance documentation is in public preview.
