Progressive decentralization is a process in which founding teams incrementally relinquish decision-making authority. This approach allows teams to focus on achieving product-market fit and building a strong community, while also creating a path towards community governance. In this concept doc, we'll elaborate upon this concept first by exploring the concept of progressive decentralization in general, and then by exploring the concept of progressive decentralization within the context of the Arbitrum DAO.

### Progressive decentralization: A general overview

The concept of progressive decentralization is particularly relevant for crypto startups building blockchain scaling solutions. These projects face a unique challenge of balancing the need for product leadership, rapid iteration, and a go-to-market strategy built upon values of community governance.

Progressive decentralization is an innovation strategy that resolves this tension by gradually transitioning decision-making authority. This process can be divided into three stages:

 1. **Product-market fit**: The first stage of progressive decentralization is focused on achieving product-market fit. Throughout this stage, the team is focused on building a product that people want. This stage is often characterized by a high degree of centralization, as the founding team initially represents the entire "community" of stakeholders. This initial team is responsible for making key decisions about the product roadmap and go-to-market strategy.

 2. **Community participation**: The second stage of progressive decentralization is focused on building a strong and engaged community. This includes creating mechanisms for community participation, such as governance forums and feedback channels. This stage is characterized by a moderate degree of centralization as the founding team directs the project's evolution with feedback captured from the community.

 3. **Decentralization**: The final stage of progressive decentralization is focused on achieving decentralization of both the technology and its governance. This includes implementing on-chain governance mechanisms, formally establishing a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), and distributing decision-making authority to the community. This stage is characterized by a low degree of centralization, as the founding team no longer has control over the direction of the project.

Progressive decentralization is important for crypto startups because it helps to limit platform risk (the risk that the rules of a platform will change against the will of its users). Community-governed technologies that use DAOs to facilitate decision-making benefit from a cooperative economic model that maintains alignment between stakeholders as the technology scales.

In summary, progressive decentralization is a strategic approach that allows crypto startups to balance the need for product leadership and rapid iteration with the goal of community governance. It's a process of gradually transitioning control from the founding team to the community, through stages of product-market fit, community participation, and decentralization.


### Progressive decentralization: In the context of the Arbitrum DAO

In the context of the Arbitrum DAO, progressive decentralization refers to the gradual transfer of decision-making authority from a centralized group of individuals (such as the founding team) to a decentralized community of $ARB governance token holders. This process is a necessary step in creating a sustainable and community-governed organization that can actively manage the risks associated with cutting-edge technology.

The <a data-quicklook-from='security-council'>Security Council</a>, a group of elected representatives within the Arbitrum DAO, represents a form of democratically managed centralization of authority. While some may argue that this represents too much centralization, it's important to understand that this is a tactical and pragmatic compromise that is necessary to engage in honest exchange of value with businesses that require security and uptime guarantees.

The process of progressively decentralizing Arbitrum's core protocols can be divided into three steps:

1. **Product-market fit:** The first step in building a successful community-governed technology organization was to create a technology that solves real problems. In the case of the Arbitrum DAO, this is the suite of Arbitrum protocols that reduce the cost and latency of decentralized applications (dApps) for users and developers.

2. **Community participation:** The second step was to educate the Ethereum community about Arbitrum's value proposition. At the same time, community participation was facilitated through traditional social media channels, partnerships, forums, and other means.

3. **Decentralization:** The final step was to decentralize the organization itself. This includes the creation of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and the implementation of on-chain governance mechanisms. The Arbitrum DAO's decisions are governed by holders of the $ARB governance token. The degree and manner of decentralization is continuously determined by members of the Arbitrum DAO. The DAO may, for example, decide to dissolve the Security Council if it can be convinced that its underlying protocol and chains are sufficiently resilient.


Progressive decentralization isn't a one-time event; it's a *progressive*, ongoing effort to continuously improve the level of decentralization within the organization. If you're a member of the Arbitrum DAO, it's especially important for you to be aware of and support efforts towards progressive decentralization in order to ensure the long-term success and sustainability of the organization. This includes the management of expectations and perceptions within and beyond the Ethereum community.
