 1. Editing for technical precision and completeness (we are here - once an SME signs off on this "core truth", we can edit for structure / clarity / brevity / consistency - see the gov docs page for details: https://www.notion.so/arbitrum/Governance-docs-46934705e74b4ae096b2fcdb3755aa40)
   - This unblocks other types of editing 
   - Other editorial feedback is welcome of course, but the most important feedback at this point is editing for technical precision and completeness. SME-signoff signals that from the SME's perspective, it looks truthful and complete.
 2. Other things that we need to do (can parallelize, but confidence will increase as we have SME signoffs on technical accuracy and completeness)
   - Editing for structure / clarity / brevity / consistency / metadata
      - Examples of things in this step: logical and patterned sections, consistent formatting, consistency across the corpus, consistent usage of proper nouns, thoughtful SEO-friendly descriptions
   - link to docs (wherever the reader is likely to want to read supporting docs, link to them inline, and wire up "next" and "prev" links at the bottom of each page)
   - wire up quicklooks (wrap first-mentions of key terms in <a data-quicklook-from> tags, and ensure the definitions are in the glossary, signed off by SMEs, and rendered using Glossary CMS)
   - ask questions and add to FAQ (wherever a given reader persona - user, dev, token-holder, delegate, proposal submitter, council member, etc) is likely to have questions, add a question to the FAQ and render it within a FAQs section by using the FAQ CMS publishing pipeline)
   - continue refining term definitions (periodically review the Glossary CMS to drive consistency and clarity through iteration, ideally with continuous peer review and support)
   - reference specific sections of the constitution from each statement, whenever possible (via markdown-not-html-footnotes that connect the statement to the constitution while disarming various forms of skepticism, confusion, and risk)
   - invite peers to help with the long-tail of todos, & peer-review content experience and comment on friction points (right now we determine gov, once the switch is flipped, it will determine us, feels important to get this right for "the spirit of our work" and risk / optics reasons)
   - confidently shift our focus to fun non-gov things together!

Progressive decentralization is a process in which founding teams relinquish control over a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) by degrees, over time. This approach allows teams to focus on achieving product-market fit and building a strong community, while also creating a path towards regulatory compliance and community ownership. In this concept doc, we'll elaborate upon this concept first by exploring the concept of progressive decentralization in general, and then by exploring the concept of progressive decentralization within the context of the Arbitrum DAO.

### Progressive decentralization: A general overview

The concept of progressive decentralization is particularly relevant for crypto startups building scaling solutions. These projects face a unique challenge of balancing the need for product leadership, rapid iteration, and a managed go-to-market strategy with the goal of community ownership and regulatory compliance.

Progressive decentralization is a way to resolve this tension by gradually transitioning control from the founding team to the community. This process is divided into three stages:

 1. **Product-market fit**: The first stage of progressive decentralization is focused on achieving product/market fit. This means that the team is focused on building a product that people want and that addresses a specific market need. This stage is often characterized by a high degree of centralization, as the founding team is responsible for making key decisions about the product roadmap and go-to-market strategy.
 2. **Community participation**: The second stage of progressive decentralization is focused on building a strong and engaged community. This includes creating mechanisms for community participation, such as governance forums and token-based incentives. This stage is characterized by a moderate degree of centralization, as the founding team is still responsible for making key decisions about the product roadmap and go-to-market strategy, but the community is able to provide input and influence the direction of the project.
 3. **Decentralization**: The final stage of progressive decentralization is focused on achieving sufficient decentralization and community ownership. This includes implementing on-chain governance mechanisms and distributing control over the protocol to the community. This stage is characterized by a low degree of centralization, as the founding team no longer has control over the direction of the project.

Progressive decentralization is important for crypto startups because it helps to limit platform risk (the risk that the rules of a platform will change against the will of its users). User-owned networks, such as DAOs, can benefit from a cooperative economic model that helps ensure that crypto services remain aligned with their users, even as they scale.

In summary, progressive decentralization is a strategic approach that allows crypto startups to balance the need for product leadership and rapid iteration with the goal of community ownership and regulatory compliance. It's a process of gradually transitioning control from the founding team to the community, through stages of product/market fit, community participation, and decentralization.


### Progressive decentralization: In the context of the Arbitrum DAO

In the context of the Arbitrum DAO, progressive decentralization refers to the gradual transfer of decision-making authority from a centralized group of individuals (such as the founding team) to a decentralized community of $ARB token holders. This process is a necessary step in creating a sustainable and democratic organization that's able to mitigate risks associated with cutting-edge technology.

The Security Council, a group of elected representatives within the Arbitrum DAO, represents a form of democratically managed centralization of authority. While some may argue that this represents too much centralization, it's important to understand that this is a tactical and pragmatic compromise that is necessary to engage in honest exchange of value with businesses that require security and uptime guarantees.

The process of progressive decentralization can be broken down into three steps:

1. **Product-market fit:** The first step in building a successful decentralized organization is to create a product that people want to use. In the case of the Arbitrum DAO, this is the Arbitrum Rollup protocol, which is designed to reduce the costs and latency of decentralized applications (dApps) for users and developers. TODO - something about exponential growth, TVL, etc.

2. **Community participation:** The second step is to encourage and facilitate participation from the community. In the Arbitrum DAO, this includes creating channels for communication and feedback, as well as implementing mechanisms for community members to have a say in decision-making through the formation of the Arbitrum DAO, which has unlocked token-based voting, governance proposals, delegates, and delegation.

3. **Sufficient decentralization:** The final step is to achieve a sufficient level of decentralization, or community ownership, both in terms of the technology and the organization. The threshhold for "sufficient" will be democratically determined by The Arbitrum DAO. It may, for example, decide to dissolve the Security Council if it can be convinced that its underlying protocol and chains are sufficiently resilient. 


Progressive decentralization isn't a one-time event; it's a *progressive*, ongoing effort to continuously improve the level of decentralization within the organization. If you're a member of the Arbitrum DAO, it's especially important for you to be aware of and support efforts towards progressive decentralization in order to ensure the long-term success and sustainability of the organization. This includes the management of expectations and perceptions within and beyond the Ethereum community.
