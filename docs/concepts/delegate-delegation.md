todos: 
 - fact check (we are here - once an SME signs off on the core truth, we can confidently stabilize the beauty of the truth - see the gov docs page for details: https://www.notion.so/arbitrum/Governance-docs-46934705e74b4ae096b2fcdb3755aa40)
   - note that this isn't editing per se - this unblocks editing - this is distributable fact-checking. Editing for consistency / brevity / clarity / etc will be an iterative process that Mick is ultimately responsible for driving before we click publish. 
   - editorial feedback is welcome of course, but the most important feedback at this point is pure fact-checking and sign-off by SMEs on the facts.
- then continue with...
   - editorial / structural cleanup (logical and patterned sections, consistent formatting, consistency across the corpus, thoughtful SEO-friendly descriptions, footnotes wherever just-in-case elaboration would be valuable)
   - link to docs (wherever the reader is likely to want to read supporting docs, link to them inline, and wire up "next" and "prev" links at the bottom of each page)
   - wire up quicklooks (wrap first-mentions of key terms in <a data-quicklook-from> tags, and ensure the definitions are in the glossary, signed off by SMEs, and rendered using Glossary CMS)
   - ask questions and add to FAQ (wherever a given reader persona - user, dev, token-holder, delegate, proposal submitter, council member, etc) is likely to have questions, add a question to the FAQ and render it within a FAQs section by using the FAQ CMS publishing pipeline)
   - continue refining term definitions (periodically review the Glossary CMS to drive consistency and clarity through iteration, ideally with continuous peer review and support)
   - reference specific sections of the constitution from each statement, whenever possible (via markdown-not-html-footnotes that connect the statement to the constitution while disarming various forms of skepticism, confusion, and risk)
   - invite peers to help with the long-tail of todos, & peer-review content experience and comment on friction points (right now we determine gov, once the switch is flipped, it will determine us, feels important to get this right for "the spirit of our work" and risk / optics reasons)
   - confidently shift our focus to fun non-gov things together!

When participating in the Arbitrum DAO, token holders have the option to either vote directly on proposals or to delegate their voting power to a delegate. In this concept doc, we'll explore the concept of delegates and delegation within the context of the Arbitrum DAO.

### What is a delegate?

A delegate is a member of the Arbitrum DAO community who has been elected to represent other token holders and vote on their behalf. Delegates are elected by token holders who choose to delegate their voting power to them. Delegates are required to follow the Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO and must act in the best interest of the token holders they represent.

### Why delegate?

Delegation allows token holders to participate in the governance of the Arbitrum DAO without having to actively keep track of every proposal and vote. By delegating their voting power to a delegate, token holders can trust that their vote will be cast in a way that aligns with their own beliefs and values.

Additionally, token holders who delegate their voting power are still able to vote on proposals directly if they choose to (?). This allows for added flexibility and the ability to "override" a delegate's vote if necessary (?).

### How to delegate

Delegating your voting power is easy and can be done through the Tally platform. Here's the basic process:

1. Connect your Ethereum wallet to Tally and navigate to the Arbitrum DAO page.
2. Select the "delegate" button.
3. Search for the delegate you would like to delegate your voting power to and confirm the delegation.

Note that you can change or revoke your delegation at any time. You can also delegate your voting power to multiple delegates if you choose (?). For more detailed how-to guidance, see TODO.

## Conclusion

Delegation is a powerful tool for $ARB token holders within the Arbitrum DAO, allowing them to participate in governance without having to actively track every proposal and vote. By electing and delegating to a delegate, token holders can trust that their vote is being cast in a way that aligns with their own beliefs and values. Remember, you always have the option to vote directly on proposals or revoke your delegation if necessary. (todo - consistent you / their language in concept docs)
