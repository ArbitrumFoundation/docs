The Arbitrum DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) built on the Ethereum blockchain. At its core, the Arbitrum DAO is a community-driven governance model that allows $ARB token holders to propose and vote on changes to the organization.

The Arbitrum DAO's governance smart contracts are implemented on the Arbitrum One rollup chain, which is a Layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain. These smart contracts facilitate the democratic management of the DAO's governance token, $ARB. The $ARB token is the native token of the Arbitrum DAO. It serves as the currency for all transactions within the organization, including governance proposals and voting. Token holders who hold more $ARB tokens have more voting power within the organization.

The Arbitrum DAO has a built-in treasury system (implemented as a smart contract - todo - link); the DAO's treasury is used to fund ongoing development and maintenance of the organization and its technology assets. A portion of all transaction fees within the DAO are automatically added to the treasury, and token holders can propose and vote on how to use these funds.

The Arbitrum DAO also has a built-in security mechanism called the Security Council. The Security Council is a group of individuals who are responsible for ensuring the security and integrity of the DAO and its chains. They can propose and vote on changes to the security protocols of the organization, and they also have the power to execute Emergency Actions in the event of a security emergency.

Overall, the Arbitrum DAO is a powerful tool for decentralized governance and community-driven management of the Arbitrum ecosystem. By holding $ARB tokens and participating in the governance process, individuals can have a direct impact on the future of Arbitrum and by extension, Ethereum.
