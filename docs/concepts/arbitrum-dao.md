todos: 
 - fact check (we are here - once an SME signs off on the core truth, we can confidently stabilize the beauty of the truth - see the gov docs page for details: https://www.notion.so/arbitrum/Governance-docs-46934705e74b4ae096b2fcdb3755aa40)
   - note that this isn't editing per se - this unblocks editing - this is distributable fact-checking. Editing for consistency / brevity / clarity / etc will be an iterative process that Mick is ultimately responsible for driving before we click publish. 
   - editorial feedback is welcome of course, but the most important feedback at this point is pure fact-checking and sign-off by SMEs on the facts.
- then continue with...
   - editorial / structural cleanup (logical and patterned sections, consistent formatting, consistency across the corpus, thoughtful SEO-friendly descriptions, footnotes wherever just-in-case elaboration would be valuable)
   - link to docs (wherever the reader is likely to want to read supporting docs, link to them inline, and wire up "next" and "prev" links at the bottom of each page)
   - wire up quicklooks (wrap first-mentions of key terms in <a data-quicklook-from> tags, and ensure the definitions are in the glossary, signed off by SMEs, and rendered using Glossary CMS)
   - ask questions and add to FAQ (wherever a given reader persona - user, dev, token-holder, delegate, proposal submitter, council member, etc) is likely to have questions, add a question to the FAQ and render it within a FAQs section by using the FAQ CMS publishing pipeline)
   - continue refining term definitions (periodically review the Glossary CMS to drive consistency and clarity through iteration, ideally with continuous peer review and support)
   - reference specific sections of the constitution from each statement, whenever possible (via markdown-not-html-footnotes that connect the statement to the constitution while disarming various forms of skepticism, confusion, and risk)
   - invite peers to help with the long-tail of todos, & peer-review content experience and comment on friction points (right now we determine gov, once the switch is flipped, it will determine us, feels important to get this right for "the spirit of our work" and risk / optics reasons)
   - confidently shift our focus to fun non-gov things together!

The Arbitrum DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) built on the Ethereum blockchain. At its core, the Arbitrum DAO is a community-driven governance model that allows $ARB token holders to propose and vote on changes to the organization.

The Arbitrum DAO's governance smart contracts are implemented on the Arbitrum One rollup chain, which is a Layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain. These smart contracts facilitate the democratic management of the DAO's governance token, $ARB. The $ARB token is the native token of the Arbitrum DAO. It serves as the currency for all transactions within the organization, including governance proposals and voting. Token holders who hold more $ARB tokens have more voting power within the organization.

The Arbitrum DAO has a built-in treasury system (implemented as a smart contract - todo - link); the DAO's treasury is used to fund ongoing development and maintenance of the organization and its technology assets. A portion of all transaction fees within the DAO are automatically added to the treasury, and token holders can propose and vote on how to use these funds.

The Arbitrum DAO also has a built-in security mechanism called the Security Council. The Security Council is a group of individuals who are responsible for ensuring the security and integrity of the DAO and its chains. They can propose and vote on changes to the security protocols of the organization, and they also have the power to execute Emergency Actions in the event of a security emergency.

Overall, the Arbitrum DAO is a powerful tool for decentralized governance and community-driven management of the Arbitrum ecosystem. By holding $ARB tokens and participating in the governance process, individuals can have a direct impact on the future of Arbitrum and by extension, Ethereum.
