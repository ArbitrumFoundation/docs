The **$ARB token** is an a digital asset (more specifically, an ERC-20 token) that's used to participate in the governance and operation of the Arbitrum DAO. It's built on the Ethereum blockchain, and is used to vote on proposals and to secure the operations of the Arbitrum technology stack, including TODO.

The **Arbitrum DAO** is a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, that's responsible for managing both the DAO's governance protocol as defined within the Constitution, and the technology assets that the DAO owns. This includes the Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova chains, Layer-2 scaling solutions built on the Ethereum blockchain. These chains use a technique called "optimistic rollups" to process large amounts of Ethereum transactions off-chain, while still maintaining the security guarantees of the underlying Ethereum blockchain.

If you own $ARB tokens, you can vote on governance proposals that affect the operation and evolution of the Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova chains. This includes proposals for upgrades to the chain, as well as proposals for how to use the funds that are collected from transaction fees.

When you vote on a proposal, you're using your $ARB tokens to signal your support or opposition. The more $ARB tokens you have, the more influence your vote will have. This is because the $ARB token is a "votable" token, meaning that it can be used to vote on proposals.

In summary, the $ARB token is a special-purpose digital asset that gives you the ability to vote on proposals that affect the operation and evolution of the Arbitrum DAO and the technology assets it owns. Holding $ARB tokens allows you democratically shape the future of the Arbitrum ecosystem alongside other values-aligned token holders.
