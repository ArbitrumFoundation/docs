The **$ARB token** is an ERC-20 token that's used to participate in the Arbitrum DAO's on-chain governance of its technology assets. The token is minted by a smart contract that lives on Arbitrum One, a Layer 2 rollup chain that implements the Arbitrum Rollup protocol (todo). It's a <a data-quicklook-from>governance token</a> that members of the Arbitrum DAO use to vote on governance proposals.

The **Arbitrum DAO** is a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, that's responsible for managing both the DAO's governance protocol as defined within the Constitution, and the technology assets that the DAO owns. This includes the Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova chains (todo).

If you own $ARB tokens, you can vote on governance proposals that affect the operation and evolution of the Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova chains. This includes proposals for upgrades to the chain, as well as proposals for how to use the funds that are collected from transaction fees.

When you vote on an on-chain proposal, you're using your $ARB tokens to signal your support or opposition. The more $ARB tokens you have, the more influence your vote will have. This is because the Arbitrum DAO's smart contracts are implemented such that votes are token-weighted, meaning that the power of a vote is determined precisely by the number of tokens the voter's wallet represents.

Note that $ARB tokens can be delegated to other wallets. This means that you can vote using your own $ARB tokens (those in your own wallet), but you can also vote using someone else's $ARB tokens as long as the owner of those tokens has delegated their voting power to you. Delegation is useful for DAO members who don't have time to commit to reviewing and discussing DAO proposals on a regular basis[^1].

In summary, the $ARB token is a special-purpose digital asset that gives its holders the ability to vote on on-chain proposals that affect the operation and evolution of the Arbitrum DAO and the technology assets it owns. Holding $ARB tokens allows you democratically shape the future of the Arbitrum ecosystem alongside other values-aligned and incentives-aligned token holders.
