[The Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO](../dao-constitution) outlines the process for electing members to the <a data-quicklook-from='security-council'>Security Council</a>, a group of individuals who are responsible for managing the risk of the Arbitrum ecosystem through the selective application of <a data-quicklook-from='emergency-action'>emergency actions</a> and <a data-quicklook-from='nonemergeny-action'>non-emergency actions</a>. The Security Council is made up of 12 members who are elected by the members of the Arbitrum DAO through a democratic process.

### The role of the Security Council

The primary role of the Security Council is to manage risks associated with the Arbitrum protocol and its ecosystem. The council is responsible for making decisions that protect the interests of the DAO, its members, and the broader Arbitrum community. The Security Council is subject to the oversight and control of the DAO's members, who have the power to remove council members if they're not acting in the best interests of the DAO.

### How the elections work

The Security Council is a 12-member council divided into two groups: the "July Cohort" and the "January Cohort". Every year, on July 15th and January 15th, there are elections to fill the seats in these two groups, respectively. The July Cohort is elected every year, and their term lasts for 6 months. The January Cohort is elected every year, and their term lasts for 1 year. This system allows for a balance of continuity and fresh perspectives.

To become a candidate for the Security Council, you must be a member of the Arbitrum DAO. You must also have support from at least 0.2% of all votable tokens. Once the candidates have been chosen, all members of the Arbitrum DAO can vote for the candidates. The 6 candidates who receive the most votes will be elected to the Security Council.

No more than 3 candidates from the same organization can be elected into the Security Council. Also, candidates shouldn't have any conflicts of interest that would prevent them from acting in the best interests of the Arbitrum DAO.

The rules for the Security Council elections can be changed by the members of the Arbitrum DAO, but these changes can't be made during an ongoing election. Security Council members can also be removed from their position if at least 10% of all votable tokens vote in favor of removal, and at least 5/6 of the votes are in favor of removal. They can also be removed if at least 9 members of the Security Council vote in favor of removal.

### Why elections are important

The Security Council elections are important because they democratically determine who will be responsible for making important decisions about the security and integrity of the Arbitrum DAO. By holding regular elections, the community can ensure that the Council is made up of members who truly represent the values enshrined within [The Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO](../dao-constitution).

In addition, the election process allows for the removal of Council members who are not acting in the best interests of the network. This helps to ensure that the Council always has the best interests of the network in mind.

### Conclusion

The Security Council and its elections are an important part of the governance of the Arbitrum DAO. By participating in the elections, community members can ensure that the Council is made up of members who truly represent their interests and those of the DAO at large.

If you're a member of the Arbitrum DAO, it's especially important for you to be aware of and support efforts towards risk management and progressive decentralization in order to ensure the long-term success and sustainability of the organization. This includes the management of expectations and perceptions within and beyond the Ethereum community.
