import DraftExpectationsPartial from '@site/docs/partials/_draft-expectations-partial.md'; 

The Arbitrum DAO treats docs like products: we start with minimum-viable content and then use feedback loops to iterate our way towards validated value.

Every governance document (excluding the [Constitution](../architecture/dao-constitution)) is initially published with the following "public preview" disclaimer:

<DraftExpectationsPartial />

We use this disclaimer to **set expectations** and to **invite feedback** from readers like you. As soon as we can convince ourselves that a given document is meeting our readers' needs, we lift the disclaimer.

### How do you know when a public preview document is ready to have its disclaimer lifted?

In general, a document is considered validated if it's 1) frequently viewed, 2) has a low bounce rate, and 3) doesn't have any open issues on GitHub/Discord. This heuristic isn't supported by precise threshholds; it's a loose and informal model that we're currently experimenting with. We'll update this document as our approach matures.

### Does this mechanism apply to The Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO?

No. The private preview mechanism does **not** apply to [The Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO](../architecture/dao-constitution.md).

### What's the difference between a draft and a public preview?

Readers generally interpret drafts as "not ready for public consumption". Arbitrum DAO's public preview documentation is ready for public consumption with the caveat that we're still learning how to optimize it for our readers.

### Does this mean that the Arbitrum DAO isn't committed to its governance documentation?

No. We're committed to our documentation, just not in the same way that we're committed to the Constitution:

 - **The Constitution** is the Arbitrum DAO's highest-order governance document. It's the only document that's subject to the formal governance proposal mechanism. In order for the Constitution to change, a proposal must be submitted to the Arbitrum DAO and approved by a majority of the Arbitrum DAO's voting power. This is a formal process that only the Arbitrum DAO can initiate and execute.
 - **Other governance documents** are derived from a combination of 1) the Constitution and 2) reader feedback. These docs frequently change via traditional pull requests issued against our governance docs repository. This is an informal, continuous, iterative process that anyone can participate in. Pull requests are reviewed and approved through judgment calls made by employees of the Arbitrum Foundation.


### Is the governance protocol itself in public preview?

No. This disclaimer applies only to the documents that display it. It doesn't apply to the protocol; it doesn't apply to the Constitution; it doesn't apply to the smart contracts; it doesn't apply to the DAO. The Arbitrum DAO's governance protocol is in production. Some of the Arbitrum DAO's governance documentation is in public preview; those docs are marked with a `PUBLIC PREVIEW DOCUMENT` disclaimer.
