import DraftExpectationsPartial from '@site/docs/partials/_draft-expectations-partial.md'; 

The Arbitrum DAO treats docs like products: we start with minimum-viable content and then use feedback loops to iterate our way towards validated value.

Every governance document (excluding the [Constitution](../architecture/dao-constitution)) is initially published with the following "public preview" disclaimer:

<DraftExpectationsPartial />

We use this disclaimer to **set expectations** and to **invite feedback** from readers like you. As soon as we can convince ourselves that a given document is meeting our readers' needs, we lift the disclaimer.


### How do you know when a public preview document is ready to have its disclaimer lifted?

In general, if a document 1) is viewed a lot, 2) doesn't have a high bounce rate, and 3) doesn't have any outstanding GitHub issues, we consider it to be validated. This is an informal process that we're currently experimenting with; we'll update this document if our approach changes.

### Does this mechanism apply to The Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO?

No. The private preview mechanism does **not** apply to [The Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO](../architecture/arbitrum-dao-constitution.md).

### What's the difference between a draft and a public preview?

Readers generally interpret drafts as "not ready for public consumption". Arbitrum DAO's public preview documentation is ready for public consumption with the caveat that we're still learning how to optimize it for our readers.

### Does this mean that the Arbitrum DAO isn't committed to its governance documentation?

No. We're committed to our documentation, just not in the same way that we're committed to the Constitution.

Our governance docs are derived from a combination of 1) the Constitution and 2) reader feedback. These docs frequently change via traditional pull requests issued against our governance docs repository. This is an informal, continuous, iterative process.

Updates to the Constitution must be proposed and approved through Arbitrum DAO's formal governance proposal mechanism; updates to all other governance documentation aren't subject to this formal process.

### Is the governance protocol itself in public preview?

No. This disclaimer applies only to the documents that display it. It doesn't apply to the protocol; it doesn't apply to the Constitution; it doesn't apply to the smart contracts; it doesn't apply to the DAO. The Arbitrum DAO's governance protocol is in production. Some of the Arbitrum DAO's governance documentation is in public preview; those docs are marked with a `PUBLIC PREVIEW DOCUMENT` disclaimer.
