The <a data-quicklook-from='arbitrum-dao '>Arbitrum DAO </a>is governed by a protocol that allows <a data-quicklook-from='arb'>$ARB</a> governance token holders to propose and vote on different actions, such as changes to the DAO's [Constitution](../dao-constitution.md) or funding for specific projects. These votes are crucial for making decisions that shape the future of Arbitrum and its technology assets.

### Types of votes

There are two types of votes in the Arbitrum DAO:

1. **Temperature check:** This is a preliminary vote that gauges the community's interest in a proposal before it moves on to the next stage. Temperature checks are conducted on the Snapshot platform and are only open to $ARB token holders who hold at least 0.01% of <a data-quicklook-from='votable-tokens'>votable tokens</a>.

2. **On-chain vote:** If the proposal passes the temperature check, it will move on to an on-chain vote facilitated by Tally. This "call for votes" can be initiated by $ARB token holders who hold at least 5,000,000 votable tokens. To be approved, nore than 50% of the votable tokens that voted on the proposal must have voted in favor of the proposal; <a data-quicklook-from='constitutional-aip'>constitutional proposals</a> must receive votes from at least 5% of all votable tokens in existence; <a data-quicklook-from='nonconstitutional-aip'>non-constitutional proposal</a> must receive votes from at least 3% of all votable tokens in existence.

### Voting power

The amount of voting power you have is determined by the number of $ARB tokens you hold. However, you also have the option to grant your voting power to a <a data-quicklook-from='delegate'>delegate</a>, who can vote on your behalf. This is a great option for token holders who may not have the time or resources to actively participate in the DAO's governance. See [How to delegate your voting power](../how-tos/select-delegate-voting-power.md) to learn more about this option.

### Values-based voting

It's important to note that the Arbitrum DAO operates on a set of values outlined in its Constitution. These values include decentralization, security, and scalability. When evaluating proposals, voters should consider whether the proposal aligns with these values and if the proposal furthers the interests of the DAO as a whole (as opposed to special interests that don't represent the DAO as a whole).

### Conclusion

Voting is an important aspect of the Arbitrum DAO's governance and allows token holders to make decisions that shape the future of the DAO. By understanding the different types of votes, your voting power, and the values that guide the DAO, you can make informed decisions when voting on proposals.
