The Arbitrum DAO is governed by a protocol that allows $AB governance token holders to propose and vote on different actions, such as changes to the DAO's Constitution or funding for specific projects. These votes are crucial for making decisions that shape the future of the DAO and its technology assets.

### Types of votes

There are two types of votes in the Arbitrum DAO:

1. **Temperature check:** This is a preliminary vote that gauges the community's interest in a proposal before it moves on to the next stage. Temperature checks are conducted on the Snapshot platform and are only open to $ARB token holders who hold at least 0.01% of votable tokens.

2. **On-chain vote:** If the proposal passes the temperature check, it will move on to an on-chain vote facilitated by Tally. The proposal must receive support from more Votable Tokens in favor than against; constitutional proposals must receive votes from at least 5% of votable tokens; non-constitutional proposal must receive votes from at least 3% of votable tokens.

### Voting power

The amount of voting power you have is determined by the number of $ARB tokens you hold. However, you also have the option to delegate your voting power to a delegate, who can vote on your behalf. This is a great option for those who may not have the time or resources to actively participate in the DAO's governance. (todo)

### Values-based voting

It's important to note that the Arbitrum DAO operates on a set of values outlined in its Constitution. These values include decentralization, security, and scalability. When evaluating proposals, voters should consider whether the proposal aligns with these values and if it's in the best interest of the DAO as a whole.

### Conclusion

Voting is an important aspect of the Arbitrum DAO's governance and allows token holders to make decisions that shape the future of the DAO. By understanding the different types of votes, your voting power, and the values that guide the DAO, you can make informed decisions when voting on proposals.
