<div id="constitution" contentEditable="true" suppressContentEditableWarning={true}>
   <p>This Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO takes effect on the date upon which the Arbitrum DAO approves Arbitrum Improvement Proposal – 1: Arbitrum Proposal Framework (“AIP-1”), located at todo:qqq.</p>

   <p>Some of the rules and procedures of this Constitution will be enforced directly by smart contracts on a blockchain, and some will not. All rules are equally binding. Actions taken under this Constitution may be on-chain or off-chain actions. On-chain actions are those that are actuated directly by the governance smart contracts of the DAO as transactions on a blockchain. Off-chain actions are those that are actuated by other means.</p>

   <p>This Constitution also includes some “recommended guidelines” which are non-binding but strongly recommended.</p>

   <p>This Constitution describes the procedures by which it may be amended. For more information regarding the governance framework of the Arbitrum DAO and Arbitrum Foundation, please see AIP-1.</p>
