todos: 
 1. Editing for technical precision and completeness (we are here - once an SME signs off on this "core truth", we can edit for structure / clarity / brevity / consistency - see the gov docs page for details: https://www.notion.so/arbitrum/Governance-docs-46934705e74b4ae096b2fcdb3755aa40)
   - This unblocks other types of editing 
   - Other editorial feedback is welcome of course, but the most important feedback at this point is editing for technical precision and completeness. SME-signoff signals that from the SME's perspective, it looks truthful and complete.
 2. Other things that we need to do (can parallelize, but confidence will increase as we have SME signoffs on technical accuracy and completeness)
   - Editing for structure / clarity / brevity / consistency / metadata
      - Examples of things in this step: logical and patterned sections, consistent formatting, consistency across the corpus, consistent usage of proper nouns, thoughtful SEO-friendly descriptions
   - link to docs (wherever the reader is likely to want to read supporting docs, link to them inline, and wire up "next" and "prev" links at the bottom of each page)
   - wire up quicklooks (wrap first-mentions of key terms in <a data-quicklook-from> tags, and ensure the definitions are in the glossary, signed off by SMEs, and rendered using Glossary CMS)
   - ask questions and add to FAQ (wherever a given reader persona - user, dev, token-holder, delegate, proposal submitter, council member, etc) is likely to have questions, add a question to the FAQ and render it within a FAQs section by using the FAQ CMS publishing pipeline)
   - continue refining term definitions (periodically review the Glossary CMS to drive consistency and clarity through iteration, ideally with continuous peer review and support)
   - reference specific sections of the constitution from each statement, whenever possible (via markdown-not-html-footnotes that connect the statement to the constitution while disarming various forms of skepticism, confusion, and risk)
   - invite peers to help with the long-tail of todos, & peer-review content experience and comment on friction points (right now we determine gov, once the switch is flipped, it will determine us, feels important to get this right for "the spirit of our work" and risk / optics reasons)
   - confidently shift our focus to fun non-gov things together!

:::caution THERE IS NO PRESALE

The only official website for the $ARB airdrop is todo:qqq. There is no presale. We won't ever ask for your seed phrase. When in doubt, [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/arbitrum) and ask away; a member of our team will be happy to help.

### User airdrop eligibility details

We use a points system to determine the number of tokens that airdrop recipients can claim. You earn maximum one point per qualifying action performed before the snapshot date. There are 14 total qualifying actions, so you can earn up to 14 points.

**Qualifying actions:**

 1. Bridged funds into Arbitrum One
 2. Conducted transactions during two distinct months
 3. Conducted transactions during six distinct months
 4. Conducted transactions during nine months
 5. Conducted more than four transactions or interacted with more than four different smart contracts
 6. Conducted more than ten transactions or interacted with more than ten different smart contracts
 7. Conducted more than 25 transactions or interacted with more than 25 different smart contracts
 8. Conducted more than 100 transactions or interacted with more than 100 different smart contracts
 9. Conducted transactions exceeding in the aggregate $10,000 in value
 10. Conducted transactions exceeding in the aggregate $50,000 in value
 11. Conducted transactions exceeding in the aggregate $250,000 in value
 12. Deposited more than $10,000 of liquidity into Arbitrum 
 13. Deposited more than $50,000 of liquidity into Arbitrum
 14. Deposited more than $250,000 of liquidity into Arbitrum

**User protections:**

To prevent bots from taking advantage of the airdrop, we've established a number of anti-sybil rules.

 - If an airdrop recipient's wallet transactions have all occurred within a 48-hour period, **one point is subtracted**.
 - If an airdrop recipient's wallet balance is less than .01 ETH, **and** if the wallat hasn't interacted with more than one smart contract, **one point is subtracted**.
 - If an airdrop recipient's wallet address has been identified as a sybil address during the Hop protocol bounty program (footnote), (todo:qqq - disqualified?). 
 - If an airdrop recipient's wallet address is part of a parent/children wallet arrangement whereby the parent has funded more than 25 children addresses, all addresses are collapsed into a single user wallet address. 

Refer to our <a href='#todo'>Sybil detection</a> documentation for more detailed information. 



### DAO airdrop eligibility details

To qualify for our DAO airdrop, your project's DAO must meet the following five criteria:

 1. The project's DAO must be live (must have deployed a smart contract to an Arbitrum chain? todo:qqq) on Arbitrum on or before the snapshot date.
 2. The project's DAO must have been listed on the Arbitrum portal on or before the snapshot date.
 3. The project's DAO must have an on-chain treasury controlled by the DAO for the benefit of its community.
 4. The project's DAO must agree to invest at least 50% of the airdropped funds into growth on Arbitrum (todo:qqq - how to be more concrete about this?).
 5. The project's DAO must agree to submit a fund utilization report to the Arbitrum DAO on the one-year anniversary of the airdropped token distribution. This report should showcase how the initially distributed funds were used. The Arbitrum DAO reserves the right to burn unvested project DAO tokens via a (todo: type of proposal) if this condition isn't satisfied.

<br />

**Distribution structure**

(todo:qqq - clarify these bits before publishing)

 - Vesting schedule
   - 50% vested upfront
