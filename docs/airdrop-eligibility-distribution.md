### Distribution info

The initial allocation of the token will be as follows:

 - **25%** to the employees of Offchain Labs (the team building Arbitrum)
 - **19%** to Offchain Labs investors
 - **5%** airdropped to the community
 - **3%** airdropped to DAOs in the Arbitrum ecosystem

### Airdrop Information and Criteria:

 - 500 million tokens will be airdropped to users of the platform 
 - 300 million tokens will be airdropped to the treasuries of DAOs whose applications are built on top of Arbitrum
 - Snapshot: Nitro Block = August 31, 2022 at Block Number [Insert Number]

#### User Airdrop

Users will receive a certain number of points to satisfy various thresholds. The total number of points earned will dictate the size of the airdrop such users receive. 

**Points Criteria**

Users who have conducted any of the actions laid below will receive one point for each distinct points criteria:

 - Has bridged funds into Arbitrum One
 - Has conducted transactions during two distinct months
 - Has conducted transactions during six distinct months
 - Has conducted transactions during nine months
 - Has conducted more than four transactions or interacted with more than four different smart contracts
 - Has conducted more than ten transactions or interacted with more than ten different smart contracts
 - Has conducted more than 25 transactions or interacted with more than 25 different smart contracts
 - Has conducted more than 100 transactions or interacted with more than 100 different smart contracts
 - Has conducted transactions exceeding in the aggregate $10,000 in value
 - Has conducted transactions exceeding in the aggregate $50,000 in value

 - Has deposited more than $10,000 of liquidity into Arbitrum 
 - Has deposited more than $50,000 of liquidity into Arbitrum
 - Has deposited more than $250,000 of liquidity into Arbitrum

**Points Eligibility for Token Drop**

 - <3 points = Not eligible to receive any tokens
 - 3 points = [qqq fill in] 
 - 4 points =
 - 5 points =
 - 6 points = 
 - 7 points = 
 - 8 points =
 - 9 points = 
 - 10 points =
 - 11 points = 
 - 12+ points = 

**User Protections**

To prevent bots from taking advantage of the airdrop, we have laid out point dedication rules. These Sybil Protections are:

 - All wallet transactions occurred within a 48-hour period = -1 point
 - Has a balance of < .01 ETH and has not interacted with more than one smart contract = -1 point 
 - Has been identified as a sybil address during the Hop protocol bounty program as listed here. 
 - “Parent” and children” addresses where the parent has funded more than 25 children addresses = collapsed into one “user” 

See here for further details on our Sybil detection criteria. 

#### DAO Airdrop 

The goal and intention of these tokens is to align the future of the Arbitrum protocol with the vast number of different communities that exist at the application level. We want to align on the future of Arbitrum with early supporters of the project. 

**Prerequisites**

 - Live on Arbitrum as of the snapshot date and listed on the Arbitrum portal as of such date.
 - Such a project has an on-chain treasury that is controlled by its DAO for the benefit of its community. 
 - 50% of funds must be used for growth on Arbitrum of the recipient’s project(s). On the one-year anniversary of the distribution, the project in question must submit to the Arbitrum DAO a report showcasing how the initially distributed funds were used. Should the DAO find the report to be unsatisfactory, the DAO shall have the right to vote to burn the unvested tokens rather than distributing them to the project. 

**Distribution Structure**

 - Vesting Schedule
   - 50% vested upfront 
   - 50% vested (quarterly) over the course of one year anniversary - two-year anniversary of distribution.
   - How to lose unvested tokens: 
     - Project no longer supports Arbitrum deployment
     - Project no longer exists 
     - Does not complete mandate of 50% of tokens being used for growing protocol on Arbitrum
 - Lockup: 
   - Immediately released: 25%
   - 9-month anniversary: 25%
   - 1/12 monthly thereafter for the next 12 months
 - Distribution Amounts:
   - Deployed Q4 2021 = 7 points
   - Deployed Q1 2022 = 5 points
   - Deployed Q2 2022 = 3 points
   - Deployed Q3 2022
   - Arbitrum Native = 5 points
   - Arbitrum/Ethereum Native = 3 points
   - Multichain Protocol 
   - More than 1,000,000 transaction = 10 points
   - More than 500,000 transactions = 5 points
   - More than 400,000 transactions = 4 points
   - More than 300,000 transactions = 3 points
   - More than 200,000 transactions = 2 points

   - Aggregate Value of transactions is greater than [$300,000,000] = 3 points
   - Aggregate Value of transactions is greater than [$200,000,000] = 2 points
   - Aggregate Value of transactions is greater than [$100,000,000]s
   - Average value of recipient DAO’s tokens on Arbitrum is greater than $50M = 5 points
   - Average value of recipient DAOs tokens on Arbitrum is greater than $40M = 4 points
