```
todos: 
 - fact check (we are here - once an SME signs off on the core truth, we can confidently stabilize the beauty of the truth - see the gov docs page for details: https://www.notion.so/arbitrum/Governance-docs-46934705e74b4ae096b2fcdb3755aa40)
   - note that this isn't editing per se - this unblocks editing - this is distributable fact-checking. Editing for consistency / brevity / clarity / etc will be an iterative process that Mick is ultimately responsible for driving before we click publish. 
   - editorial feedback is welcome of course, but the most important feedback at this point is pure fact-checking and sign-off by SMEs on the facts.
- then continue with...
   - editorial / structural cleanup (logical and patterned sections, consistent formatting, consistency across the corpus, thoughtful SEO-friendly descriptions, footnotes wherever just-in-case elaboration would be valuable)
   - link to docs (wherever the reader is likely to want to read supporting docs, link to them inline, and wire up "next" and "prev" links at the bottom of each page)
   - wire up quicklooks (wrap first-mentions of key terms in <a data-quicklook-from> tags, and ensure the definitions are in the glossary, signed off by SMEs, and rendered using Glossary CMS)
   - ask questions and add to FAQ (wherever a given reader persona - user, dev, token-holder, delegate, proposal submitter, council member, etc) is likely to have questions, add a question to the FAQ and render it within a FAQs section by using the FAQ CMS publishing pipeline)
   - continue refining term definitions (periodically review the Glossary CMS to drive consistency and clarity through iteration, ideally with continuous peer review and support)
   - reference specific sections of the constitution from each statement, whenever possible (via markdown-not-html-footnotes that connect the statement to the constitution while disarming various forms of skepticism, confusion, and risk)
   - invite peers to help with the long-tail of todos, & peer-review content experience and comment on friction points (right now we determine gov, once the switch is flipped, it will determine us, feels important to get this right for "the spirit of our work" and risk / optics reasons)
   - confidently shift our focus to fun non-gov things together!
```


Use the following scenarios to test your comprehension of the different components of the Arbitrum DAO protocol, such as the Security Council, AIPs, on-chain and off-chain actions. By exercising your understanding of these scenarios, you'll be better equipped to confidently navigate the process, technology, and governance proposals that support the Arbitrum DAO.


### Scenario 1: You have an idea that you'd like to propose to the Arbitrum DAO

#### What's the first step you should take?
The first step is to submit the idea as an Arbitrum Improvement Proposal (AIP) on the public [Arbitrum DAO governance forum](https://forum.arbitrum.io/) and discuss/debate it for 1 week. You'll then perform a more formal "temperature check" on Tally. This procedure is referred to as the Temperature Check phase within the [Constitution](dao-constitution.md) and is technically optional, but it's strongly recommended as a due-diligence governance best practice. Although the process for submitting an AIP to the governance forum isn't explicitly outlined in the Constitution, the Constitution does specify that the DAO may approve and implement AIPs to change the rules governing the system. See [How to submit a DAO proposal](./how-tos/create-submit-dao-proposal) for more detailed instructions on how to submit an AIP.


### Scenario 2: A security emergency arises on one of the Arbitrum DAO-governed chains

#### How can the DAO respond to the security emergency?
The Security Council, a committee of 12 members who are signers of a multi-sig wallet, has powers to perform certain Emergency Actions and Non-Emergency Actions, as delegated to it by the Arbitrum DAO and Arbitrum Foundation, and is responsible for upholding this Arbitrum DAO Constitution. It should handle the emergency immediately by either implementing the required software upgrade or perform whatever other mitigating action is required in order to remedy the situation. This type of Security Council action is known as an Emergency Action and requires a 9-of-12 approval from the Security Council. The Security Council shouldn't use its power to perform Emergency Actions except in a true security emergency, such as a critical vulnerability that could significantly compromise the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of a chain governed by the Arbitrum DAO. After performing an Emergency Action, the Security Council must issue a full transparency report to explain what was done and why the Emergency Action was justified. Interesting notes:

- The Arbitrum DAO is able to modify the Security Council's powers or to eliminate the Security Council entirely through the submission, approval and implementation of a Constitutional AIP.
- The Arbitrum DAO is able to curtail or eliminate the Security Council's power to perform Emergency Actions via approval and implementation of a Constitutional AIP.
- The Security Council may also approve and implement routine software upgrades, routine maintenance and other parameter adjustments in a non-emergency setting (such actions, "Non-Emergency Actions"), which require a 7-of-12 approval in order to take effect.
- Equivalent "copies" of the Security Council multi-sig contracts (7-of-12, in the case of Non-Emergency Actions, and 9-of-12, in the case of Emergency Actions) exist, one on Ethereum and another on each Arbitrum DAO-governed chain.
- Any Non-Emergency Action, after approval by the Security Council, will bypass Phases 1 to 3 of the AIP process and instead directly go through Phases 4 to 7 of the AIP process, to provide a delay before any Non-Emergency Action is deployed. The Security Council may optionally specify additional delays before deployment.


### Scenario 3: You want to propose a change to the system parameters of one of the Arbitrum DAO-governed chains

#### What's the process for proposing and implementing this change?

The process for proposing and implementing changes to system parameters is as follows:

1. Submit the proposal as an Arbitrum Improvement Proposal (AIP) on the public forum, which will be discussed and debated for 1 week (Temperature Check phase).
2. The AIP moves to a voting phase, where token holders can vote on the proposal.
3. If the proposal passes the vote, it moves to a delay period before implementation.
4. After the delay period, the change can be implemented by the chain owner(s) through a transaction on the blockchain.

Note that the Security Council may also approve and implement routine software upgrades, maintenance and other parameter adjustments in a non-emergency setting. This bypasses Phases 1 to 3 of the AIP process and goes directly through Phases 4 to 7. This is done to prevent routine upgrades and maintenance from being delayed or filibustered by the temperature check, voting, and delay phases of the AIP process.


### Scenario 4: You want to propose a change to the Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO

#### What's the process for proposing and implementing this change?

The process for proposing and implementing changes to the Constitution is as described in the Constitution itself. It involves submitting the proposal as an AIP, and then going through the same voting and delay phases as any other proposal. The proposal must pass with a supermajority of Votable Tokens being voted in favor of the change. Changes to the Constitution must also be ratified by the Security Council with a 7-of-12 approval in order to take effect.


### Scenario 5: You want to propose a new Arbitrum DAO-governed chain

#### What's the process for proposing and implementing this change?

The process for proposing and implementing a new Arbitrum DAO-governed chain involves submitting the proposal as an AIP, and then going through the same voting and delay phases as any other proposal. The proposal must pass with a supermajority of Votable Tokens being voted in favor of the change. The new chain must also be authorized by the Arbitrum DAO through a corresponding AIP. The new chain must be governed solely by the Constitution and the procedures as described in TODO.


### Scenario 6: You want to become a member of the Security Council

#### What's the process for becoming a member of the Security Council?

The Security Council has 12 members, who are divided into a July cohort of 6 members, and a January cohort of 6 members. Every year on July 15th, 12:00 UTC, an election starts for the July 6th cohort seats; and every year on January 15th, 12:00 UTC, an election starts for the January 6th cohort seats. To become a member of the Security Council, you would need to be elected through this process.


### Scenario 7: You want to upgrade the Arbitrum One chain

#### What's the process for upgrading the Arbitrum One chain?

The process for upgrading the Arbitrum One chain involves submitting a proposal as an AIP and going through the same voting and delay phases as any other proposal. The proposal must pass with a supermajority of Votable Tokens being voted in favor of the change. The upgrade must also be approved by the Security Council with a 7-of-12 approval in order to take effect. The chain owner(s) will then perform the upgrade by updating the contract implementation of any of Arbitrum's core protocol [Transparent Upgradeable Proxy contracts](https://developer.arbitrum.io/useful-addresses), and adjusting system parameters (for example: through `setter` methods in the [ArbOwner precompile](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/precompiles/ArbOwner.sol)).

It's important to note that the upgrade should be thoroughly tested and reviewed by the community and experts in the field before being proposed and implemented. Any upgrade should also be compliant with the applicable laws, in particular sanctions-related regulations.


### Scenario 8: The Arbitrum DAO experiences a season of voter apathy.

#### Will this prevent work from being done on the chains that the Arbitrum DAO owns?

 No, voter apathy won't prevent work from being done on the chains that the Arbitrum DAO owns. The Constitution allows for off-chain actions to be taken, which don't require the approval of token holders. The Security Council has the power to perform Emergency Actions with a 9-of-12 approval, which can be used to address critical issues that cannot wait for voter approval. While voter participation is important for the proper functioning of the DAO, the Constitution has built-in mechanisms to ensure that work can continue to be done even in the event of low voter turnout.

Note that voter apathy could have an impact on the governance of the DAO, and certain decisions and actions might not be as representative of the community's collective will if voter turnout is low.


### Scenario 9: You've claimed $ARB tokens, but you don't have time to actively participate in Arbitrum DAO's governance.

#### What options do you have?

If you've claimed $ARB tokens but don't have time to actively participate in the Arbitrum DAO's governance, you have a few options:

1. You can delegate your voting rights to another member of the community who you trust to make decisions that align with your interests. See TODO
2. You can hold onto your $ARB tokens and vote when you have the time, but please note that some important decisions may have already been made.
3. You can sell or transfer your $ARB tokens to another member of the community who is more active.

While participating in governance is an important aspect of being a DAO member, it's not mandatory. As long as you hold $ARB tokens, you have a right to participate in the Arbitrum DAO's governance protocol, but you also have the right to choose not to participate. No pressure :).


### Scenario 10: You want to propose a change to the way that unclaimed airdropped $ARB tokens are distributed

#### What's the process for proposing and implementing this change?

The process for proposing and implementing changes to the distribution of unclaimed airdropped $ARB tokens involves submitting a proposal as an AIP and going through the same voting and delay phases as any other proposal. The proposal must pass with a supermajority of Votable Tokens being voted in favor of the change. Additionally, the change must also be approved by the Security Council with a 7-of-12 approval in order to take effect. The distribution of unclaimed airdropped $ARB tokens should be thoroughly evaluated and reviewed by the community and experts in the field before being proposed and implemented.


### Scenario 11: A malicious whale purchases a majority of Votable Tokens.

#### Can the whale destroy the DAO?

A malicious whale purchasing a majority of Votable Tokens doesn't necessarily mean that the DAO can be destroyed. The Constitution has built-in mechanisms to prevent any single entity from having too much control over the DAO. For example, the Security Council can perform Emergency Actions that require a 9-of-12 approval, which can be used to address critical issues that cannot wait for voter approval. The Constitution also allows for off-chain actions to be taken, which don't require the approval of token holders.

It's worth noting that this theoretical malicious whale's ownership of the majority of Votable Tokens will give them significant influence over the governance of the Arbitrum DAO, and might make it harder for the other members to pass their proposals. In such cases, the community should consider different ways to mitigate the influence of a single entity such as token-curbing mechanisms, or implementing a cap on the maximum percentage of tokens an individual or an entity can own. Please note that this scenario is a risk for any decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and it's important for the community to be aware of it and have measures in place to mitigate it.


### Scenario 12: A governance proposal passes that you voted against.

What options do you have?

#### If a governance proposal passes that you voted against, you have a few options:

 1. You can accept the outcome and continue to participate in the DAO. 
 2. You can engage in further discussions and debates on the community forum to express your dissenting opinion and try to sway others to your point of view. 
 3. You can propose a new AIP that addresses the issues you have with the proposal that passed and try to get it passed through the voting process. 
 4. You can choose to disengage from the DAO altogether and sell your Votable Tokens before the proposal takes effect. This is facilitated by the time delay between the proposal passing and the proposal taking effect.
