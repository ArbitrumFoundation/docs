The following block of text is an authoritative articulation of the Arbitrum DAO's governance protocol. This protocol has been immutably enshrined within the smart contracts that the Arbitrum DAO uses to govern both itself and the Arbitrum Rollup Layer-2 protocol.

:::

<div id="constitution">
   <p>This Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO takes effect on the date upon which the Arbitrum DAO approves Arbitrum Improvement Proposal – 1: Arbitrum Proposal Framework (“AIP-1”), located at todo:qqq.</p>

   <p>Some of the rules and procedures of this Constitution will be enforced directly by smart contracts on a blockchain, and some will not. All rules are equally binding. Actions taken under this Constitution may be on-chain or off-chain actions. On-chain actions are those that are actuated directly by the governance smart contracts of the DAO as transactions on a blockchain. Off-chain actions are those that are actuated by other means.</p>

   <p>This Constitution also includes some “recommended guidelines” which are non-binding but strongly recommended.</p>

   <p>This Constitution describes the procedures by which it may be amended. For more information regarding the governance framework of the Arbitrum DAO and Arbitrum Foundation, please see AIP-1.</p>
