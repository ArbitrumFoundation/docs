### What is a tokens circulating supply

A token's circulating supply is the amount of coins that are currently available to be transferred and utilized in the network. 

### How can I calculate the Arbitrum token circulating supply

The circulating supply is based on the [initial distribution](airdrop-eligibility-distribution#distribution-post-aips-11-and-12) and the [unlock schedule](airdrop-eligibility-distribution#vesting-and-lockup-details) of the team and investors.
You can calculate the Arbitrum token's current circulating supply with the following formula:

The team, contributor, and investor tokens unlock over a 4 year period, starting from 16 March 2023.
The first unlock starts on 16 March 2024, and continue to unlock on a monthly cadence.

The Arbitrum Foundation tokens also unlock over a 4 year period, starting from 17 April 2023.
The first unlock starts on 17 April 2023, and continue to unlock every second.


_Note that the amount unlocked by the Arbitrum Foundation is based on the 700 million tokens, with another 50 million tokens that were previously held. The team and investor tokens unlocked are calculated as the number seconds in a year divided by 12 from March 16 2024._
