This how-to will teach you how to submit proposals to the Arbitrum DAO. It assumes familiarity with Ethereum and smart contracts, but otherwise makes no assumptions about your experience with governance protocols.


## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following:

- An Ethereum wallet compatible with Tally, the DAO operations platform that we use to facilitate governance.
- At least todo:qqq% of votable tokens in your wallet's address (for submitting Snapshot polls).
- At least todo:qqq votes delegated to your wallet's address (for submitting on-chain proposals). 


## What you can expect to learn

In this how-to, you'll learn:

- The process for creating and submitting proposals to the DAO, including both off-chain and on-chain proposals.
- The difference between Constitutional and Non-Constitutional proposals.
- How to submit a proposal on the public forum and conduct a temperature check on Snapshot.
- How to use Tally to submit an on-chain proposal.
