<!-- temporary meta - ideally, our how-tos are titled as single, succinct tasks. we can add a bit of verbosity to the slug & description to catch people searching for create & submit while keeping the visible copy tight -->

The process for creating and submitting proposals to the DAO includes both off-chain and on-chain components. The first two steps include a temperature check on the public forum and a Snapshot poll. If passed, a formal proposal can be submitted on-chain using Tally, a DAO operations platform. If you are looking to submit a proposal but do not have enough votes to submit a proposal on Snapshot, consider asking for support on the forum or other community outlets, such as Discord and Twitter.

There are two types of proposals an individual can bring to the DAO: Constitutional and Non-Constitutional. These proposals differ in what they can enact and have differing levels of required thresholds to pass. For more information on the types of proposals and their differences, you can visit the constitution. For examples of proposal submissions, visit the governance forum.

The first steps in submitting a proposal to the Arbitrum DAO begin off-chain, and can be done as follows:

Submit a post on the public forum with your proposal included
Allow for at least one week of discussion and debate
Conduct a temperature check on Snapshot through a poll (must be submitted by an address with at least 0.01% of votable tokens)
Runs for one week and is decided by a simple majority
A proposal that fails should not be submitted for an on-chain vote
In order to successfully submit a snapshot proposal, consider reaching out to delegates, or seeking voting power from the rest of the community

If a proposal passes the temperature check then it can move to an on-chain vote. The voting power requirements for submitting an on-chain vote are higher, and proposers should work to include feedback brought up during the forum discussion and temperature check period into the formal proposal that is brought on-chain.

Congrats! You’ve successfully passed the temperature check and are ready to bring a proposal to an on-chain vote. This might require a bit more coordination due to the higher voting threshold, and the need to draft the executable on-chain actions, and you can do so as follows::

Log in to Tally using a compatible wallet
Depending on the type of proposal you’re submitting, choose the correct Arbitrum DAO page by navigating to the ‘explore DAOs’ section or clicking on your profile and clicking ‘Your DAOs’:
For Constitutional Proposals: Select Arbitrum Constitution
For Non-Constitutional Proposals: Select Arbitrum Treasury
Select ‘Create new proposal’
To submit an on-chain proposal, you must have at least 5,000,000 votes delegated to your address
Give the proposal a name and description (preview image is optional)
Ensure that you’re submitting the correct type of proposal to the right DAO page in Tally, you can reference the table at the top of this page, or visit the constitution to confirm
Add proposal actions to be executed if passed
For example, transfer x amount of ETH to 0x address
Preview your proposal and either save as a draft or submit on-chain
A proposal passes if more votes are cast in favor than against, and if the total number of votes cast in favor is at least the following fraction of the votable tokens:
5%, for a Constitutional proposal
3%, for a non-Constitutional proposal



If the proposal passes, cheers, after a short delay (depending on the proposal), the proposal’s actions will be executed on-chain.

If the proposal doesn’t pass, but there is interest in submitting it, refer to the constitution on resubmission guidelines, and work to ensure that feedback is taken into account, especially if there is strong feedback as to why the proposal did not pass.

Hopefully, this helps serve as a rough guide to creating and submitting proposals to the Arbitrum DAO. This system is in its early days and will likely evolve and change shape over time – all facilitated through proposals. For any other questions related to proposals, or to get started in the process, visit the forum, and welcome to the future of governance!
