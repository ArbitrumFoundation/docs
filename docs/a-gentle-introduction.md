**In a nutshell:**

- Arbitrum Rollup is an optimistic rollup protocol that makes Ethereum transactions cheaper and faster while inheriting Ethereum’s security.
- Developers use Arbitrum to significantly reduce the cost of their Ethereum smart contracts. See our [gas cost estimator](https://gas.arbitrum.io/) and [L2Fees](https://l2fees.info/) for details.
- Governance of the Arbitrum Rollup protocol is now being decentralized through the distribution of $ARB governance tokens.
- $ARB tokens can be used to vote on Arbitrum DAO governance proposals, allowing $ARB holders to shape Arbitrum’s future together.
- Token holders will be able to delegate voting power to trusted individuals. These individuals are called delegates.
- **To determine your airdrop eligibility**, connect your wallet to the Arbitrum One network on [gov.arbitrum.io](http://gov.arbitrum.io) and follow the prompts. Do this by (todo).
- **To become an Arbitrum DAO delegate**, review the below material and then **submit your application** (todo).
- **To build apps using Arbitrum,** check out our [developer docs](https://developer.arbitrum.io/intro/).
