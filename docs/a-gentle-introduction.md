**In a nutshell:**

- Arbitrum Rollup is an optimistic rollup protocol that makes Ethereum transactions faster and cheaper while inheriting Ethereum's security guarantees [[1]](#footnote-1). Developers use Arbitrum to build user-friendly decentralized apps.
- Governance of the Arbitrum Rollup protocol is now being decentralized through the distribution of $ARB governance tokens.
- $ARB tokens can be used to vote on Arbitrum DAO governance proposals, allowing $ARB holders to shape Arbitrum’s future together.
- Token holders will be able to delegate voting power to trusted individuals. These individuals are called delegates.
- **To determine your airdrop eligibility**, connect your wallet to the Arbitrum One network on [gov.arbitrum.io](http://gov.arbitrum.io) and follow the prompts. Do this by (todo).
- **To become an Arbitrum DAO delegate**, review the below material and then **submit your application** (todo).
- **To build apps using Arbitrum,** check out our [developer docs](https://developer.arbitrum.io/intro/).

### Hello! What’s Arbitrum again?

Arbitrum Rollup is an optimistic rollup protocol that makes Ethereum transactions cheaper and faster. Developers use Arbitrum to build user-friendly decentralized apps.

Our flagship chain, Arbitrum One, was [launched in 2021](https://offchain.medium.com/introducing-arbitrum-one-our-mainet-beta-ed0e9b63b435). This was quickly followed by the launch of [Arbitrum Nova](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/introducing-nova-arbitrum-anytrust-mainnet-is-open-for-developers-9a54692f345e), a separate [AnyTrust chain](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/introducing-anytrust-chains-cheaper-faster-l2-chains-with-minimal-trust-assumptions-31def59eb8d7) built for developers who need ultra low-cost transactions. In August 2022, Arbitrum One was [upgraded to the Arbitrum Nitro stack](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/arbitrum-nitro-one-small-step-for-l2-one-giant-leap-for-ethereum-bc9108047450), bringing a 7-10x upgrade to Arbitrum’s scaling capabilities.

Governance of the Arbitrum Rollup protocol is now being decentralized through the distribution of $ARB governance tokens.


### What? What's governance? What year is it?

Governance is the way that decisions get made. To understand what this means, let’s compare traditional web2 governance to web3 governance.

**Web2 technologies** are traditionally built by corporations governed by a board of directors. This board is usually a small group of people elected by shareholders. 

When a big corporate decision needs to be made, members of the board meet and vote. The board’s decision-making protocols aren’t always visible to shareholders. Although the board has a fiduciary duty to its shareholders, shareholders must trust the board. This is a sort of social contract expressed as corporate legalese and enforced by law.

**Web3 technologies** (like Arbitrum) are often built by corporation governed *initially* by a board of directors. Once these technologies achieve product-market fit, the board can gradually decentralize its decision-making authority. This is called [progressive decentralization](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/), and it’s what Arbitrum is doing. Progressive decentralization is usually facilitated by three key ingredients:

1. **DAO formation**: DAO = [Decentralized autonomous organization](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/09/20/daos.html). The DAO gradually absorbs the board’s decision-making authority. Arbitrum’s DAO is the Arbitrum DAO.
2. **Governance token launch**: Ownership of governance tokens represents membership within the DAO. Token holders can vote on DAO proposals. Arbitrum’s governance token is $ARB, and will be distributed to eligible wallet addresses via an upcoming airdrop.
3. **Code**: DAO governance is usually facilitated by a series of open source [smart contracts](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_2.html) that enforce a specific decision-making protocol. These *trustless* smart contracts are used to gradually replace the traditional board’s *trusted* social contract. Arbitrum DAO uses smart contracts to codify the decision-making protocol articulated within the Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO.

It’s 2023.
