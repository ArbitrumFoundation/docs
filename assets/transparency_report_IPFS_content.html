                          The establishment of The Arbitrum Foundation, a Cayman
                          Islands foundation company, was a critical first step
                          in the establishment of the DAO. The Arbitrum
                          Foundation serves the ArbitrumDAO community and is
                          governed by it, aiming to foster the growth and
                          development of the Arbitrum ecosystem while remaining
                          accountable to the community.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          This document acknowledges the actions that were
                          required in advance of the DAO setup in order to
                          legally comply with registration and operational
                          requirements. The Arbitrum Foundation believes it is
                          important for the community to understand all actions
                          taken in the lead-up to DAO formation (especially for
                          one as large as this), and therefore seeks to describe
                          documents and activities conducted by the Foundation
                          on the DAO&#x27;s behalf.

                          has occurred thus far; the structure of a
                          decentralised autonomous organisation (the
                          &quot;ArbitrumDAO&quot;), that is governed by holders
                          of $ARB, responsible for fostering, developing,
                          authorising and governing the ArbitrumDAO-governed
                          chains (as defined in the

                          The ArbitrumDAO has the ability to submit Arbitrum
                          Improvement Proposals
                          (&quot;<strong>AIPs</strong>&quot;), vote on them and
                          approve through on-chain execution or actions of The
                          Arbitrum Foundation. The guiding values of The
                          Arbitrum Foundation and ArbitrumDAO are described in
                          Section 5 of the
                          <a

                          Through the submission of AIPs in line with the
                          constitution, the ArbitrumDAO is able to collectively
                          decide and effectuate changes ranging from core
                          protocol technology to non-technical decisions that
                          otherwise impact the community and $ARB tokenholders.
                          Throughout this transparency report below, it&#x27;s
                          noted where decisions made during Foundation setup can
                          be modified by an AIP, and the process for doing so.

                          As a Cayman Islands foundation, The Arbitrum

                        <p>
                          The Arbitrum Foundation incurred pre-launch costs to
                          set up the Arbitrum DAO and governance. The work
                          included careful consideration and guidance of legal
                          structures and technical expertise and development.
                          This was done in the spirit of providing a safe, legal
                          and technical framework to allow the DAO to
                          self-govern on a trusted platform, and to allow for
                          the safe transfer of the Arbitrum One and Arbitrum
                          Nova networks to the DAO from both a technical and
                          legal perspective.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          With the launch of the ArbitrumDAO, the responsibility
                          for operation of the Arbitrum network was transferred
                          to the ArbitrumDAO. As part of its responsibilities to
                          the DAO, the Foundation has assumed the costs of
                          paying for operations, blockchain operation,
                          infrastructure, service contracts, and ongoing
                          improvements to the Arbitrum ecosystem. In addition,
                          the net on-chain fee revenue (the net difference
                          between fees collected by on-chain operations and L1
                          fees paid by the Sequencer) from the Arbitrum One and
                          Arbitrum Nova chains is now being sent to the
                          ArbitrumDAO treasury. As such, the ArbitrumDAO will
                          need to ensure The Arbitrum Foundation is adequately
                          funded going forward to continue operating core
                          infrastructure for the Arbitrum network including the

                          In total, 7.5% of the token supply was distributed to
                          the Foundation when the token supply was generated.
                          0.5% of $ARB tokens were needed to complete initiation
                          of the DAO. Of the 0.5%, 0.4% of $ARB tokens were
                          provided as a loan as previously disclosed. The other
                          0.1% was sold to meet the obligations of initial
                          governance setup and initial and near-term operating
                          funds. This has been distributed to the Foundation in
                          order to satisfy these upfront and near-term costs on
                          behalf of the DAO.

                          distributed to the on-chain DAO treasury, 11.62% to
                          individual wallets, and 1.13% have been allocated to

                          The decision was made for a distribution of 20% of the
                          L2 base fee on the Arbitrum Nova chain with a split of
                          8% to the Data Availability Committee and 12% to the
                          Arbitrum Nova Validators. These entities are critical
                          given the security, availability, and performance that
                          they provide to Arbitrum Nova, with this distribution
                          enabling these groups to provide continued support.
                          This allocation can be reduced, expanded, or
                          eliminated pursuant to a Constitutional AIP approved
                          by the ArbitrumDAO.

                          The DAC and Validators are only given a share of the
                          base fee but not congestion fees, so that no member
                          will be incentivized to promote on-chain congestion.
                          100% of Nova&#x27;s congestion fees and the remaining
